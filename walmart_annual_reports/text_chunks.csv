RISK FACTORS The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U. S. and globally. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.",711,104,177.75,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U. S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U. S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical and digital retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.",2580,389,645.0,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through the omni-channel integration of our physical and digital retail operations.

Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns.",1085,154,271.25,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf
92,23,"walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf:The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital platforms or through the combination of both. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.

The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A. As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross- store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.

Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U. S. operations and our business. During fiscal 2018, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales.

These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union. Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil.",1166,176,291.5,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U. S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U. S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U. S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U. S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U. S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U. S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.",1863,279,465.75,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U. S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") was enacted and contains significant changes to U. S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U. S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. In addition, the Company was subject to a one- time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U. S. income tax.

Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made and could impact our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity.

We operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.

In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.

The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings.

Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.

While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% and 7.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.",898,135,224.5,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

The decline in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period.

For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases.

Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.

The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns.

When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could also cause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.

Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level.

Although impairment charges for fiscal 2018 were $1.4 billion, these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in Note 14, as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.

Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach.",1038,159,259.5,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.

All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.

Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

In addition, cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of $300 million and $265 million at January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2018, was held outside of the U. S. Of the Company's $6.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2017, $5.9 billion was held outside of the U. S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.

Accordingly, the Company intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U. S. in its foreign operations. As part of the U. S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact its assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. If the Company's intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U. S., although any repatriation under new U. S. tax laws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes.

Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from: • insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; • banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; • suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and • real estate transactions. Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U.

Leases The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter.

Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation.",832,127,208.0,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain on sale of the property. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are initially recorded at cost.

Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.",937,147,234.25,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.",1018,150,254.5,walmart/WMT-2018_Annual-Report.pdf

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. With the interconnected components of this flywheel strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.

Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U. S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.

Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.",660,94,165.0,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Impairment charges on assets held and used were immaterial in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2022 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. In fiscal 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, the United Kingdom and Japan met the held for sale criteria. As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion recorded in fiscal 2021, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental charges associated with the United Kingdom and Japan divestitures upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.",1073,169,268.25,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives.",838,121,209.5,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.",969,148,242.25,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.46",1072,177,268.0,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U. S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U. S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.",894,141,223.5,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption.

For fiscal 2022, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.2 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.

Based on January 31, 2022 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the U. S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt.

Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential loss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to determine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from that proceeding. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made.",1086,175,271.5,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

To test the Company's assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors, reviewed opinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 18, 2022 52",1586,224,396.5,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U. S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021"") and January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020"").",911,132,227.75,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method.

There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2022 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles.

All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.7 billion and $4.1 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",730,112,182.5,walmart/WMT-FY2022-Annual-Report.pdf

Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U. S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U. S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.

Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.

Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.

When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. Comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the  performance of our existing U. S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year.",1124,166,281.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Sales of a store that has changed  in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store’s retail square feet of more than  five percent. Additionally, sales related to e-commerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.

S. dollar into U. S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.

We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, which we discuss below. In addition, we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders  in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed  in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. We include Return on Assets (“ROA”), the most directly comparable  measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U. S. (“GAAP”),  and Return on Investment (“ROI”) as metrics to assess returns on assets.",931,145,232.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
823,23,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Return on Assets and Return on Investment Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 7.2% and 7.5% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. ROI was 15.2% and 15.5% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.",673,106,168.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
824,23,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The declines in ROA and ROI were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these periods. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the aver- age of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months  multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.",1071,165,267.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI dif- fers from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.",1046,163,261.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to  generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial perfor- mance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.",988,156,247.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

The increase in net cash  provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2017 from  fiscal 2016 was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.

829,24,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not  represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made  for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information  to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous  methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.

S. For fiscal 2017, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Mexico were the primary cause of the $2.7 billion loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges. We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component  of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U. S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $147 million and $290 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U. S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2017.",1365,217,341.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2017 would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of $11 million. In addition to currency swaps, we have designated foreign-currency- denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net invest- ments of certain of our foreign operations. At January 31, 2017 and 2016, we had £2.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom. At January 31, 2017, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and  understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and dis- closure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.",1045,155,261.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
870,32,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from  our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they  are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined  primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method for substantially all of the Walmart U. S. segment’s  inventories.",651,102,162.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
871,32,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The inventory at the Walmart International segment is  valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam’s Club segment is valued using the LIFO method.",434,69,108.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
872,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:32 Walmart 2017 Annual Report Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping’s retail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent mark- downs. The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the  ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage.",860,132,215.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
873,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determina- tion of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on  inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price  indices.",743,112,185.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
874,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:At January 31, 2017 and 2016, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between  physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annual inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results. Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill and assets with  indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment  indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, such as operating income and cash flows.",773,114,193.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
875,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of  conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes  in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be  performed, which could result in management determining the value  of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired.",913,140,228.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
876,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is  necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on  the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot  be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the  fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the  cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets.",967,150,241.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
877,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different  conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are  subject to income taxes in the U. S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax  contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U. S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U. S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.",929,148,232.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
878,33,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised  in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.",834,124,208.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
879,34,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Walmart 2017 Annual Report 33 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because  of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization  and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations  of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant  quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred  tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected  taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.",1131,172,282.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping  and saves time for our customers. Each week, the Company serves over 260 million customers who visit its 11,695 stores under 59 banners in  28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. The Company’s strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.",766,115,191.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
891,42,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The Company’s operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U. S., Walmart International and Sam’s Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”), January 31, 2016 (“fiscal 2016”) and January 31, 2015 (“fiscal 2015”). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities’ operations. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method.",788,111,197.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
892,42,walmart/2017-annual.pdf:These investments are immaterial to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (“U. S.”) and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no  significant intervening events during January 2017 that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in  conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles.,617,88,154.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
893,42,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management’s estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased  of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents.",696,105,174.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
894,42,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and $3.4 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respec- tively. In addition, cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of $265 million and $362 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements. The Company’s cash balances are held in various locations around  the world. Of the Company’s $6.9 billion and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, $5.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, were held outside of the U. S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company’s non-U. S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.",994,158,248.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
895,42,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U. S. and anticipates the Company’s domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, the Company intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company’s earnings held outside of the U. S. in our foreign operations. When the income earned, either from operations or through intercom- pany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U. S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U. S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit. If the Company’s intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company’s foreign operations could be repatriated to the U. S., although any repatriation under current U. S. tax laws would be subject to U. S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Although there can be no assurance of the impact  on the Company of potential federal tax reform in the U. S., the Company does not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U. S. to have a material effect on the Company’s overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.",1455,229,363.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from: • insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; • banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; • consumer financing programs in certain international operations; • suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and • real estate transactions. The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select  countries. The receivable balance from consumer credit products was $1.2 billion, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $79 million at January 31, 2017, compared to a receivable balance of $1.0 billion, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $70 million at January 31, 2016.",1106,175,276.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $10.0 billion, $9.4 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively.",1283,195,320.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
900,43,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were $36 million, $39 million and $59 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Leases The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming  the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole dis- cretion of the Company. The expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic  life of the asset, whichever is shorter.",1046,175,261.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
901,43,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company’s capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor’s construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor’s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor’s project, the Company performs a sale- leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.",917,135,229.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
902,43,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:If the Company is deemed to have “continuing  involvement,” the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a  non-cash gain on sale of the property. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are stated at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in cir- cumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level or, in certain circumstances,  a market group of stores.",844,136,211.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
903,43,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Undiscounted cash flows expected to be  generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets’ useful  lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Impairment charges of long-lived assets for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not material. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.",905,142,226.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
904,43,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or  quantitative approach for each of the Company’s reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If man- agement determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the  reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot  be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.",1023,154,255.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
905,43,walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed  by determining the fair value of the related reporting units.

906,44,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Walmart 2017 Annual Report 43 The Company’s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test. Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.

(2) Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U. S. acquisitions primarily relates  to Jet.com, Inc. (“jet.com”). Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.",1273,206,318.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
907,44,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using  valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited  to, workers’ compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.",898,128,224.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
908,44,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:On a regular basis, claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third-party  actuaries to ensure liability estimates are appropriate. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers’ compensation, general liability and auto liability. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (“temporary differences”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.",870,122,217.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
909,44,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by  a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and quali- tative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated  by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.",907,140,226.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
910,44,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

While management does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company’s consoli- dated net income, balance sheet or cash flows, the ASU will impact  the timing of recognition of some revenue and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts. Management expects the most significant timing change to result from the revenue associated with the unredeemed portion of Company issued gift cards, which will be recognized over the expected redemption period of the gift card under the new standard rather than waiting until the likelihood of redemption becomes remote or waiting for the gift card to expire. Additionally, management continues to assess the guidance and the related interpretation to determine if that guidance will impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts.

The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which  prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.",725,121,181.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
938,51,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:  January 31, 2017 January 31, 2016 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps   designated as fair value hedges $ 5,000 $ (4) $ 5,000 $ 173 Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps   designated as net investment hedges 2,250 471 1,250 319 Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps   designated as cash flow hedges 3,957 (618) 4,132 (609) Total  $11,207 $(151) $10,382 $(117) Additionally, the Company has available-for-sale securities that are measured at fair value on recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.",1562,251,390.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company’s assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, other  indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets, and investments, are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not record any significant impairment charges to assets  measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 or 2016.

Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of  the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.",718,112,179.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
942,52,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the  possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company’s exposure due to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requir- ing collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated “A-” or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to entering into derivative transactions, the Company regu- larly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties.",856,119,214.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

The Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company’s net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2017, and had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2016. The Company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.",948,136,237.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf
944,52,"walmart/2017-annual.pdf:The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recog- nized in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company’s net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been,  and is not expected to be, significant.",1039,160,259.75,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Fair Value Instruments The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company’s exposure due to credit loss. The Company’s interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the deriva- tive instruments match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges.",905,143,226.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024. Net Investment Instruments The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are con- tracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss,  offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.",869,132,217.25,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. At January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016, the Company had ¥10.0 billion of outstanding  long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £2.5 billion at January 31, 2017  and January 31, 2016 that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom.",944,142,236.0,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

Cash Flow Instruments The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with  the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U. S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U. S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated  as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the  assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness)  is based on total changes in the related derivative’s cash flows.",1046,159,261.5,walmart/2017-annual.pdf

S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures and certain U. S. tax credits as further discussed in the “Cash and Cash Equivalents” section of the Company’s significant accounting policies in Note 1. The Company’s non-U. S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U. S. statutory tax rate. Certain non-U. S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U. S. and are not subject to current U. S. income tax. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.

S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but  undistributed earnings of the Company’s international subsidiaries of approximately $26.6 billion and $26.1 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U. S. However, if any portion were to be  distributed, the related U. S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecog- nized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation. The Company provides deferred or current income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings.

Net activity in the valuation allowance  during fiscal 2017 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2017, decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial state- ments for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U. S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U. S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.",1941,293,485.25,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1063,15,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U. S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.",1702,252,425.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

See ""Item 1. Business"" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions.",655,95,163.75,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns.

Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business. Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.

The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; geo-political events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U. S. stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores. For example, our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by riots and looting in Chile which resulted in us closing a number of our stores until the disruption abated.

Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct.",667,98,166.75,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

S. Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the recent coronavirus outbreak which could result in potential disruptions or delays to our global supply chain), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U. S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.",2198,333,549.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims.

In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements.

Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience.",1857,273,464.25,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms.

Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions.

Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, modified, lost or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.",2057,293,514.25,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (""PBMs""). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.

Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U. S.. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U. S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U. S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U. S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act.

Traffic is now referred to as ""transactions"" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as well as for comparable eCommerce activity. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.

We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. Because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for fiscal 2019 was not revised.

As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.

For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018, offset by a full year of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. For fiscal 2019, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2019 decreased primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019.

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.",1327,196,331.75,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1180,43,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U. S. segment's inventories.",632,95,158.0,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1181,43,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.",650,105,162.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1182,43,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.",660,94,165.0,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.",982,145,245.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1185,44,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.",622,92,155.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1186,44,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U. S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite- lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.",970,149,242.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1187,44,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings.",881,128,220.25,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1188,44,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",1184,199,296.0,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1189,44,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U. S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U. S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U. S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.",894,141,223.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.",790,115,197.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf
1193,45,"walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf:On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") was enacted and contains significant changes to U. S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U. S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U. S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. ITEM 7A.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company’s determinations regarding the measurement of loss. To test the Company’s assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed opinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.",930,141,232.5,walmart/Walmart_2020_Annual_Report.pdf

Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls.

RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U. S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face.",891,141,222.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1399,16,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:Strategic Risks Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate. Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise strategy.",1333,190,333.25,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1400,16,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. With the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns.",1693,251,423.25,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business. We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services.",1693,241,423.25,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U. S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.

The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics or epidemics are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other epidemic could impact our business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in- place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Customer behaviors changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand.",1267,183,316.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

Other factors and uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments, including for any variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the pandemic or epidemic on our business, including consumer behaviors.

Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.",2107,295,526.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole.",1038,156,259.5,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.

Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.

Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes.",916,135,229.0,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1538,48,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories The Walmart U. S. segment comprises the largest portion of our inventory and is primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") valuation method. The majority of the Sam's Club segment inventories are accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method.",703,104,175.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1539,48,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. As a measure of sensitivity, an incremental 1% inflationary impact to the cost of our inventory purchases would not have resulted in a material increase to the LIFO provision recorded during fiscal 2023. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. Indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.",978,148,244.5,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1540,48,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.",823,117,205.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1541,48,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of 47,395,67,98.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf
1542,49,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

1543,49,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:We are subject to income taxes in the U. S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U. S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U. S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.",1052,163,263.0,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.",769,115,192.25,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates. As guidance is issued by the U. S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.",950,140,237.5,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt.

1560,54,"walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf:Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 17, 2023 53",1586,224,396.5,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U. S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021"").",976,138,244.0,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (""U.

There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2023 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.,793,113,198.25,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U. S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U. S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U. S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions.",1240,197,310.0,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting (""RIM"") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") valuation method. RIM generally results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. •Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method. • Sam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted- average cost LIFO method.",1043,161,260.75,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

Leases For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease.

Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.

Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition.

Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 3,245 $ 3,135 $ 1,817 Increases related to prior year tax positions  79  170  92 Decreases related to prior year tax positions  (248)  (97)  (264) Increases related to current year tax positions  357  75  1,582 Settlements during the period  (89)  (5)  (64) Lapse in statutes of limitations  (37)  (33)  (28) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,307 $ 3,245 $ 3,135 The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.",1580,253,395.0,walmart/Walmart-2023-Reports-Optimized.pdf

The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company.

In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.

We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and the European Union put in alternative trade and other arrangements. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.

From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability. Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year.

In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U. S. dollar into U. S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.

As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million and $508 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.38 Sam's Club Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2017 Including Fuel Net sales $ 57,839 $ 59,216 $ 57,365 Percentage change from comparable period (2.3)% 3.2% 0.9% Calendar comparable sales increase 5.4 % 2.8% 0.5% Operating income $ 1,520 $ 915 $ 1,628 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 1.5% 2.8% Unit counts at period end 599 597 660 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 88 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 52,332 $ 54,456 $ 53,289 Percentage change from comparable period (3.9)% 2.2% 1.8% Operating income $ 1,383 $ 797 $ 1,576 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 1.5% 3.0% (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices.",1955,321,488.75,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements.",831,121,207.75,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U. S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices.",727,110,181.75,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

As of January 31, 2019 and 2018, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level.",728,111,182.0,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019.

The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.",933,132,233.25,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

As of January 31, 2019, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U. S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite- lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired.

The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets.

We are subject to income taxes in the U. S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.

(""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni- channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves over 275 million customers who visit its more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries.

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.",759,103,189.75,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2019 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.",724,105,181.0,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",730,111,182.5,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U. S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U. S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U. S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.

Restricted Cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows–Restricted Cash (Topic 230), which requires restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018. Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $34 million as of January 31, 2019, primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $300 million as of January 31, 2018, primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",944,138,236.0,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U. S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.

The expected lease term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected lease term and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter.

In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have ""continuing involvement,"" the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term.",934,138,233.5,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are initially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.",702,109,175.5,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.",1064,160,266.0,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U. S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.",613,86,153.25,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.

The adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, which the Company classifies in other gains and losses. The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction.",1138,167,284.5,walmart/Walmart-2019-AR-Final.pdf

Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.

Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivatives will change.

Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivatives with counterparties rated ""A-"" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to entering into derivatives, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties.

Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings.

The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss.
