In practice, both aspects are important for the successful creation and operation of a marketing system. Many of these results are also based on or related to models developed in scientiﬁc marketing by academic researchers.1.1 the subject of algorithmic marketing One of the traditional deﬁnitions of marketing describes it as the activ- ity of deﬁning products and services offered by a company and com- municating them to existing or potential customers.

More recent interpretations emphasize the role of product discovery and convenience to buy, with the argument that distribution is becoming less relevant with the rise of digital marketing channels [Lauterborn, 1990].',\n",

The short summary is that the sub- ject of algorithmic marketing mainly concerns the processes that can be found in the four areas of the marketing mix and the automation of these processes by using data-driven techniques and econometric methods.1.2 the definition of algorithmic marketing We deﬁne algorithmic marketing as a marketing process that is auto- mated to such a degree that it can be steered by setting a business objective in a marketing software system. This implies that the market- ing system should be intelligent and knowledgeable enough to under- stand a high-level objective, such as the acquisition of new customers or revenue maximization, to plan and execute a sequence of business actions, such as an advertisement campaign or price adjustment, with the aim of achieving the objective, and to learn from the results to correct and optimize the actions if needed. This basic principle is illus- trated in Figure 1.1.',\n",

Let us brieﬂy review several business cases that laid the foundation for algorithmic marketing in search of the patterns and characteristics that enabled the systematic approach.1.3.1 Online Advertising: Services and Exchanges The history of internet advertising can be traced back to May 3, 1978, when the ﬁrst spam email was sent to 400 users of the computer net- work ARPANET, deployed at that time in just four locations: the Uni- versity of Utah, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, and Stanford Research. Fif- teen years later, by 1993, when ARPANET had developed into the In- ternet and the spread of the Web enabled multimedia websites, the market of banner ads appeared. This new market originally relied on direct selling of banner slots offered by website publishers to advertis- ers, but this approach started to lose its efﬁciency very quickly when there was a surge in the number of websites.',\n",
