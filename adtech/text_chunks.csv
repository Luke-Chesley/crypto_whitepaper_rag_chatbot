This book is a manual for doing just that. Both marketing practitioners and technology providers will ﬁnd this book very useful in guiding them through the marketing value chain and how to fully digitize it. A comprehensive and indispensable reference for anyone undertaking the transformational journey towards algorithmic marketing.” —Ali Bouhouch, CTO, Sephora Americas “Introduction to Algorithmic Marketing isn’t just about machine learning and economic modeling.",704,106,176.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This book brings practicality to concepts that just a few years ago would have been dismissed as mere theory. It features principled framing that captures what the best marketers innately feel but cannot express.",393,62,98.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
3,4,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Elegant math articulates the important relationships that are so elusive to tra- ditional business modeling. The book is unapologetic for its lack of spreadsheet examples – much of the world can not be represented linearly in just a few dimensions and devoid of uncertainty. Instead, the book embraces rigorous framing that yields better insights into real phenomenon. It’s written neither for the data scientist nor the marketer, but rather for the two combined!Its this partnership between these two departments that will lead to real impact.",544,85,136.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It shows how data science becomes an essential part of every marketing activity. The book details how data-driven approaches and smart algorithms result in deep automation of traditionally labor-intensive marketing tasks. Decision-making is getting not only better but much faster, and this is crucial in our ever- accelerating competitive environment. It is a must-read for both data scientists and marketing ofﬁcers–even better if they read it together.” —",531,80,132.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The scarcity of data scientist talent, combined with the difﬁculty of adapting academic models, generic open-source software and algorithms to industry-speciﬁc contexts are among the difﬁculties confronting digital marketers around the world. This book by Ilya Katsov draws from the deep domain expertise he developed at Grid Dynamics in delivering innovative, yet practical digital marketing solutions to large organizations and helping them successfully compete, remain relevant, and adapt in the new age of data analytics.” —Eric Benhamou, founder and General Partner, Benhamou Global Ventures; former CEO and Chairman of 3Com and Palm",869,124,217.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Leaving the artistic aspect aside, the very way in which Van Gogh poses the question about the painters of the future and answers it is striking and admirable. Van Gogh, no doubt, was right in anticipating that the artists of the upcoming century would develop skills that have never yet been seen and questioning the ways of doing art.

Adopters of such methods, however, traditionally struggled with challenges related to incompleteness of data, complexity of real- life marketing settings, inﬂexibility of business processes, and software limitations. The challenges were especially overwhelming in areas that required far-reaching strategic decisions, where human judgment was often the only viable solution for practical applications. The advancement of digital marketing channels changed the game and created an environment that requires millions of micro-decisions to be made, which simply cannot be done efﬁciently without intelli- gent marketing software and algorithms.

For instance, this potential cannot be fully achieved without tailoring personalized experiences for millions of individual customers, which, in turn, requires millions of unique decisions to be made. Moreover, ubiquitous digital media and mobile devices have empowered customers to go through the entire marketing funnel from research to purchase in seconds, anywhere and anytime, and this per- vasive micro-moment behavior requires marketing decisions to be taken in microseconds as well. This environment introduces the challenge of building marketing systems that make decisions and act at an un- precedented level of autonomy, scale, and depth of analysis. In certain cases, not only can individual decisions and analytics be done in a data-driven way, but entire business processes can be planned, exe- cuted, measured, and optimized by an automatic software system.",976,144,244.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
59,17,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Although the problem of marketing automation can be studied from different perspectives, including economics, management, statistics, and engineering, the creators of such systems have to line up all of these pieces into a cohesive set of methods that can be efﬁciently implemented in software to achieve the business objectives. Leading a modern marketing technology project is not unlike conducting an orchestra of diverse instruments and making them operate in concert. We take exactly this perspective on marketing throughout this book and put together the results of the vast experience gained by developers of marketing systems in retail, online advertising, and other industries over the last few decades, as well as the guiding theoretical principles. It should be noted that we deliberately focus on the results reported by industry practitioners that have proved to be useful in business solutions, rather then theoretical and academic studies. Fortunately, the number of methods, models, and architec- tures published by such practitioners is high and sometimes provides a great level of detail.",1106,167,276.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

More recent interpretations emphasize the role of product discovery and convenience to buy, with the argument that distribution is becoming less relevant with the rise of digital marketing channels [Lauterborn, 1990].",902,133,225.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
62,18,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This categorization is well known as the marketing mix. The mix can be viewed as a set of variables that a marketing manager or marketing software can control to inﬂuence the position of products and brands in the market. Each component of the marketing mix represents a broad area that can be viewed and studied from different perspectives. The subject of algorithmic marketing can be better understood by distin- guishing the following two aspects of marketing activities: strategy and process. We use the term strategy to label long-term top-level business decisions that deﬁne the value proposition of the company and set the overall direction for its marketing processes.,676,108,169.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
63,18,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:For example, a retailer has to deﬁne its target market, customer services, and product lines as parts of the business strategy. The process is an implementation of the strategy that focuses on tactical decisions that support continuous functioning of the company. Continuing the example with a retailer, high-level pricing and promotional strategies require numerous deci- sions about how to select consumers for promotional campaigns or how prices for individual products should change over time. Although the scope of neither strategy nor tactical processes can be rigorously deﬁned, and there is no clear boundary between these two counterparts, we can argue that the strategy side is more focused on ex- ploration, analysis, and planning involving human judgment, whereas the process side is more focused on execution, micro-decisioning, and, most importantly, automation. This makes the process side of market- ing especially attractive for our study, although both strategy and pro- cess can be described from the viewpoint of data science and clearly",1057,160,264.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The short summary is that the sub- ject of algorithmic marketing mainly concerns the processes that can be found in the four areas of the marketing mix and the automation of these processes by using data-driven techniques and econometric methods.1.2 the definition of algorithmic marketing We deﬁne algorithmic marketing as a marketing process that is auto- mated to such a degree that it can be steered by setting a business objective in a marketing software system. This implies that the market- ing system should be intelligent and knowledgeable enough to under- stand a high-level objective, such as the acquisition of new customers or revenue maximization, to plan and execute a sequence of business actions, such as an advertisement campaign or price adjustment, with the aim of achieving the objective, and to learn from the results to correct and optimize the actions if needed. This basic principle is illus- trated in Figure 1.1.",987,158,246.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Although it would be ideal for a programmatic system to be perfectly automated and autonomous, we do not consider this a principal goal or design requirement. On the contrary, a programmatic system is typ- ically maintained by many people, including data scientists, engineers, and analysts, who develop and adjust models and algorithms to im- prove the system’s efﬁciency and capabilities. It can also consume the outputs of strategic analysis and planning done elsewhere with non- programmatic methods and, possibly, in connection with some other problems.",832,126,208.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In some senses, it is even invalid to draw such a boundary because algorithmic systems are just a method of answering old mar- keting questions, not posing new ones. However, it is evident that the level of marketing automation differs sharply across industries, which indicates that some environments are more favorable in that regard than others. Conversely, successful acquisition of advanced algorithmic methods can drastically transform an industry and create increasingly better conditions for further development.",859,122,214.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
68,20,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Analysis of such favorable environments is a natural starting point for understanding algorith- mic marketing. Let us brieﬂy review several business cases that laid the foundation for algorithmic marketing in search of the patterns and characteristics that enabled the systematic approach.1.3.1 Online Advertising: Services and Exchanges The history of internet advertising can be traced back to May 3, 1978, when the ﬁrst spam email was sent to 400 users of the computer net- work ARPANET, deployed at that time in just four locations: the Uni- versity of Utah, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, and Stanford Research. Fif- teen years later, by 1993, when ARPANET had developed into the In- ternet and the spread of the Web enabled multimedia websites, the market of banner ads appeared. This new market originally relied on direct selling of banner slots offered by website publishers to advertis- ers, but this approach started to lose its efﬁciency very quickly when there was a surge in the number of websites.",1005,162,251.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
69,20,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:It became operationally difﬁcult or even impossible for advertisers to run ad campaigns and manage budgets across thousands of publishers. On the other hand, publishers needed a robust and centralized way to sell their inventory at scale. The challenge was taken up by ad networks that acted as brokers between publishers and advertisers. DoubleClick, launched in 1996, of- fered a platform that enabled advertisers to run ad campaigns across a wide network of websites, dynamically customize a campaign accord- ing to its performance, and measure the return on investment. This created a perfect environment for automatic decision making because",646,99,161.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
70,21,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:6 introduction the measurements and adjustments could be done dynamically. How- ever, it was not really programmatic at that time. The online search engines, meanwhile, were also struggling to im- prove their advertising capabilities. Advertisers paid for the number of times their ad was demonstrated by the search engine – the cost per thousand impressions (CPM) model – similarly to banner ads. This approach was inﬂexible from the pricing perspective, causing certain revenue losses for search engines, and also from the targeting perspec- tive because irrelevant ads were not penalized in any way.",602,93,150.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
71,21,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The break- through happened in 1998 when the GoTo.com search engine intro- duced an automated auction model with two innovative features: • Advertisers could bid how much they would be willing to pay to appear at the top of the results for speciﬁc search queries. •Advertisers paid per click, not per impression. The per-pay-click (PPC) model improved both revenues and ad rele- vancy because advertisers who were willing to pay for top ad spots for speciﬁc search queries generally offered more relevant and better re- sources. This model was adopted by Google in 2002 with one principal improvement: the ad was selected based on Google’s expected revenue, not the bid amount. Google measured the click-through rate for each ad as a ratio between clicks and impressions, and the expected revenue was estimated as revenue “ bid price ˆ click-through rate This was a programmatic self-learning technique that optimized the business objective, both in terms of revenue and relevancy, because click-through rates tend to be low for irrelevant ads, so even high- budget advertisers were not able to clog up the bandwidth.",1117,181,279.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
72,21,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The trajectories of ad networks and search engines converged in 2007–2009 with adoption of the auction model across the board. Adver- tisers and publishers became connected by ad exchanges that accepted real-time bids for individual ad impressions, and a new era of real-time bidding, commonly abbreviated as RTB, thus began. The advent of RTB exchanges gave impetus to programmatic tools for advertisers – data- management platforms (DMPs) and demand-side platforms (DSPs) – that provided the ability to collect data about the behavior of Internet users and make bids on RTB exchanges depending on the estimated propensity of a given user to respond. The success of RTB was impres- sive: the share of inventory sold by DoubleClick (acquired by Google by that time) through RTB rose from 8% in January 2010 to 68% in May 2011 [Google Inc., 2011].",846,138,211.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
73,22,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:1.3 historical backgrounds and context 7 Reﬂecting on the history of RTB, we can conclude that one of the most prominent achievements of programmatic advertising is a frame- work that enables owners of consumer bases, originally the publishers of web content, to provide personalized marketing services to parties who are limited in their ability to interact with consumers, originally the advertisers of products and services. The infrastructure that sits in between the publishers and advertisers is typically provided by an independent party and includes the following: • Advertising services that enable advertisers to run advertising cam- paigns using the publisher’s resources. These services are typi- cally used to connect multiple advertisers with multiple publish- ers and resemble a marketplace where resources are sold and bought, often on a bidding basis. •Data services that collect and store information about consumers, taking it from publishers, advertisers, and third parties. Advertis- ing services take advantage of this data to run ad campaigns and make real-time automatic decisions on ads to be delivered.",1128,169,282.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Other types of consumer-base owners, such as retailers and mobile opera- tors, were also looking for an efﬁcient way to commercialize their data and relationships with consumers, and other types of service users, such as banks, product manufacturers, and insurance companies, were willing to know more about their customers and have more channels for communication with them. For instance, a manufacturer of con- sumer packaged goods can use a retailer’s channels, such as stores and eCommerce websites, to offer personalized discounts to consumers to promote new products and increase their market share. Consequently, advertising services and data services started to trans- form into the more generic model illustrated in Figure 1.2, which rep- resents a multipurpose marketplace of services and data that connects actors from different industries. The range of services offered by such a marketplace can go far beyond advertising, covering areas like credit scores and insurance premiums.",1058,159,264.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 eliminated many controls and enabled air- lines to freely change prices and routes. It opened the door for low-cost carriers, who pioneered simpler operational models, no-frills services, and reduced labor costs. One of the most prominent examples was PeopleExpress, which started in 1981 and offered fares about 70 per- cent lower than the major airlines. The low-cost carriers attracted new categories of travelers who had rarely traveled by air before: college students visiting their families, leisure travelers getting away for a few days, and many others.",797,121,199.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The advent of low-fare airlines was a growing threat to the major carriers, who had almost no chance to win the price war. Moreover, the established airlines could not afford to lose their high-revenue business travelers in pursuit of the low-revenue market. The solution was found by American Airlines.

The problem, however, was how to prevent the business travelers from purchasing tickets at discounted prices. The basic solution was to introduce certain constraints on the discounted offers; for example, the tickets had to be purchased at least three weeks in advance and were non-refundable. The challenging part was that the surplus of seats varied substantially across ﬂights and the optimal allocation could be achieved only by using dynamic optimization. In 1985, after a few years of development, American Airlines released a system called Dynamic Inventory Allocation and Maintenance Optimizer (DINAMO) to man- age their prices across the board.",772,119,193.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The success of revenue management in the airline in- dustry is clearly related to the speciﬁc properties of the inventory and demand in this domain: • The demand varies signiﬁcantly across customers, ﬂights, and time: the purchasing capacity of business travelers can be much higher than that of discretionary travelers, peak ﬂights can be much more loaded than off-peak, etc. •The supply, that is, the available seats, is not ﬂexible. The airline produces seats in large chunks by scheduling ﬂights, and once the ﬂight is scheduled, the number of seats cannot be changed. Unsold seats cannot be removed, so the airlines’ proﬁt completely depends on its ability to manage the demand and sell efﬁciently.",905,145,226.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The idea that mar- keting decisions could be supported by mathematical modeling and optimization methods began to gain currency in the 1960s, a fact that can be attributed to several factors. First, marketing science was inﬂu- enced by advances in operations research, a discipline that deals with decision-making and efﬁciency problems in military and business ap- plications by using statistical analysis and mathematical optimization. Operations research, in turn, arose during World War II in the context of military operation planning and resource optimization. Second, the advancement of mathematical methods in marketing can be attributed to technological changes and the adoption of the ﬁrst mainframes in organizations, which made it possible to collect more data and im- plement data analysis and optimization algorithms.",1113,170,278.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The advancement of digital channels has changed the situation dras- tically. Digital media created the need and the opportunity to make millions of micro-decisions at the level of individual customers and provide totally new services, such as product search or real-time mo- bile notiﬁcations.

To summarize, we can say that traditional economic modeling, data science, software engineering, and conventional marketing practices are all important for the creation of programmatic systems.1.4 programmatic services The marketing mix model deﬁnes four factors that can be controlled by a company to inﬂuence consumer purchase decisions: product, pro- motion, price, and place.

Consequently, we can make our problem statement more speciﬁc by deﬁning a set of services, each of which implements a cer- tain function and has its own inputs (objectives) and outputs (actions). There are different options for how the marketing mix can be broken down into functional services depending on the industry and busi- ness model of a particular company. We choose to deﬁne six major functional services that are relevant for a wide range of business-to- consumer (B2C) verticals: promotions, advertisements, search, recom- mendations, pricing, and assortment. These six services are the main subject of this book, and we will spend the later chapters discussing how to design and build them.",899,144,224.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Let us brieﬂy review these relationships and some common design guidelines that will be used in the rest of this book to streamline the detailed discussions of individual services. The relationships between the six services we have deﬁned, as well as their connections to the marketing mix, can be established as follows: • The primary purpose of promotion and advertisement services is to match customers with offerings and convey the right message to them. This typically requires customers to be found who can be incentivized to do actions that contribute toward the desired business objective. The capability for identifying the right cus- tomers and offerings is the keystone of this service group.",741,118,185.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The principal goal of these services is to enable and simplify product discovery, which is related to the Place and Promotion domains of the market- ing mix. This group of services requires an understanding of the purchasing intent of the customer, expressed either explicitly or implicitly, and the ability to ﬁnd offerings that match it well. •The goal of pricing and assortment services is to determine and optimize the set of offerings and their properties, including price.",866,135,216.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This group mainly covers the Price and Product domains of the marketing mix. This three-group classiﬁcation, illustrated in Figure 1.4, is convenient because it reﬂects the similarities in the objectives and design princi- ples shared across the services. We structure the rest of this book on the basis of these three groups to address both fundamental capabili- ties, such as identiﬁcation of the right customers for an offering, and individual services.

The concept of the programmatic method accentuates the objective- driven design approach, so we can attempt to deﬁne a common frame- work by starting with the notion of the business objective. In order to understand and execute the objective, a programmatic service is likely to include a certain set of functional components that can have different designs for different domains (see Figure 1.5): • Since any automatic decision making is driven by data, the decision-making pipeline starts with data collection.

This generally requires the development of one or more models that consume a candidate solution and produce signals that indi- cate the level of ﬁtness. For example, a promotion service can rely on a model that scores the customer according to their propensity to buy a certain product, a pricing service can score different pricing options according to expected proﬁts, and a search ser- vice can score products by their relevance for a query. •",737,117,184.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A busi- ness action, however, often requires the combination of many sig- nals and intermediate decisions into the ﬁnal action plan. For example, a marketer can send promotions to the most valuable clients, which requires individual customers to be evaluated, but the ﬁnal mailing list has to be constrained to the campaign bud- get. Thus, programmatic services typically contain an optimiza- tion or signal-mixing component that makes the ﬁnal decisions. •A programmatic service communicates with the outside world through marketing channels and integrates with other services.",695,104,173.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

These services can be used internally by the company that owns the customer base or can be sold to a third party. Programmatic com- ponents should be self-contained, well-packaged, and able to imple- ment a reasonably high level of abstraction to be sold as high-value services. •A programmatic service often acts as a dynamic controller of demand and, consequently, a counterpart of supply-chain man- agement.

The design principles differ across the services, but a few functional capabilities and logical components are widely used across all service types.

In business applications, data analytics methods are often categorized at a high level into three distinct types: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. Descriptive an- alytics refers to methods for data summarization, data quality assess- ment, and ﬁnding correlations. Examples of descriptive analytics are management reports providing aggregated sales data or market basket analyses yielding information about the products frequently bought to- gether.

Finally, prescriptive analytics refers to modeling of the dependency between decisions and future outcomes for optimal decision making. One of the basic examples of prescriptive analysis is price optimiza- tion where the proﬁt is modeled as a function of the price, so that one can estimate how many dollars of proﬁt would be generated by ev- ery dollar of price discount and determine the proﬁt-optimal discount value. In the marketing domain, data-related activities and processes are commonly viewed through the lenses of these three types of analytics, and all three types are important.",841,137,210.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The ﬁrst step we need to take as we begin to discuss the algorithmic approach is to translate this business language into more formal models that describe the ob- jective we are trying to achieve, the space of possible actions, and the constraints we should meet. Most marketing problems translated into this econometric language are naturally optimization problems that ex- press business metrics, like revenue, as a function of possible actions, such as marketing campaigns or assortment adjustments, and require the optimal action to be found from among the various possible strate- gies.",1038,159,259.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
111,35,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The economic model is also a function of data in the sense that it uses properties and parameters estimated from past experience. For instance, consider a retailer planning a marketing mailing campaign. The space of possible actions can be deﬁned as a set of send/no-send decisions with regard to individual customers, and the revenue of the campaign depends both on actions, that is, who will receive the incen- tive and who will not, and data, such as expected revenue from a given customer and mailing costs.

The design of model G completely depends on the application. We will discuss the construction of different models in the next chapters in the context of particular marketing problems, but there are several basic considera- tions that should be taken into account in any model design. First, we need to deﬁne the business objective and express it as a nu- merical metric that can be a subject of optimization. In many cases, it is reasonable to model and optimize the proﬁt, but, as we will see later, other objectives can be set for particular applications.",782,136,195.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
113,36,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The design of the objective can be especially challenging if the objective represents a trade-off between the enterprise’s proﬁt and the usefulness to the con- sumer, for example, a search in an online catalog that should provide results both relevant to the query entered by the consumer and aligned with the merchandising goals and rules. Second, we should account for available data or address the data collection problem. The role of data mining in problem 2.1 is crucial because model G, which links the actions with the outcomes, can be complex and may have to be determined from data by means of re- gression analysis or other data mining techniques. In some cases, the model cannot be completely speciﬁed, either because of high complex- ity (e. g., user behavior cannot be precisely predicted) or because it is impossible to extrapolate the existing data to the case in point (e. g., the action is to introduce a completely new product or service). In either case, the data should be treated as a business asset that might require investment, and there is a trade-off between the cost of data acquisi- tion and the value delivered by the acquired data.",1161,197,290.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Third, the model can be created at different levels of granularity. We can express the same objective by using different models depending on the space of possible actions, available data, and our knowledge of the business constraints. One of the key considerations in model design is the level of data aggregation.

The monthly revenue can therefore be described as G “ ÿ u qum (2.2) The retailer wants to run a promotion campaign that boosts sales by the factor of k, and the cost of each promotion is c. The retailer can control both k and c by choosing a more or less aggressive promotional strategy. Consequently, the optimization problem to be solved can be deﬁned as max s ÿ u k ¨ qum ´ c (2.3) in which s is the promotional strategy determined by the pair of pa- rameters k and c. We can see that the deﬁnition in terms of individual consumers is redundant, and the problem can be redeﬁned in terms of aggregates, namely the total demand Q “ ÿ u qu (2.4) and the total budget of the campaign C. Thus, the problem is deﬁned as max s k ¨ Q ¨ m ´ C (2.5) Let us now assume that the retailer wants to create two different consumer segments and assign the strategy si “ pki, ciq to one of these segments and the strategy sj “ pkj, cjq to the other segment.

The ﬁrst thing we note is that the economic modeling process is concerned only with certain metrics of the company or consumer that are directly related to the modeled objective. Examples of such metrics are the demand for a certain product or the propensity of a consumer to respond to a promotion.

In probabilistic terms, this can be expressed as the conditional distribution ppy | xq (2.7) in which x is the vector of factors and y is the metrics. In the example with discounts, x can include variables like the price of a given product, prices of related products, and competitor prices, and y is the demand measured in units sold.

We will refer to the elements of such a prepared vector x as features or independent variables and to y as the response label or de- pendent variable. With the assumption that we have n samples and m features, all feature vectors can be represented as an n ˆ m matrix, X, called the design matrix, and all response variables as an n-dimensional column-vector y. Each row of the design matrix X is a feature vector x and each element of y is a response label y.

The parametric approach makes the assumption that the data distribution has a cer- tain functional form speciﬁed by a ﬁxed number of parameters, so the problem of distribution estimation can be redeﬁned as the problem of model ﬁtting, that is, the selection of model parameters θ so that the distribution model pmodelpy | x, θq (2.13) can be optimally ﬁtted with the data. The optimality condition, of course, needs to be formally speciﬁed as well.

The neighborhood of the input vector x can be determined by using any vector distance metric, such as Euclidean distance.

In other words, the model uses only local observations and cannot generalize the patterns observed through the data set. This problem can be allevi- ated by using parametric models, which provide less ﬂexibility because of the limited number of parameters but which learn these parameters globally.2.4.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Model ﬁtting is an optimization problem in its own right, so we need to specify an objective function that will be optimized.",868,141,217.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Thus, the estimation error will be ϵ “ y ´ ypxq “ y ´ wT x (2.23) With the assumption that the error has a normal distribution, the dis- tribution of the estimate produced by the model is also described by a normal distribution, that is, the Gaussian with the mean wT x and the variance σ2: ppy | x, wq “ N ´ y | wT x, σ2¯ “ ˆ 1 2πσ2 ˙ 1 2 exp ˆ ´ 1 2σ2 ´ yi ´ wT xi ¯2˙ (2.24) By inserting this probability distribution into the deﬁnition of the log- likelihood deﬁned in equation 2.18 and doing some algebra, we get the following log-likelihood expression that has to be maximized: LLpwq “ n ÿ i“1 log ppy | x, wq “ n ÿ i“1 log N ´ y | wT xi, σ2¯ “ ´ 1 2σ2 SSEpwq ´ n 2 logp2πσ2q (2.25) in which SSE is the sum of squared errors, deﬁned as SSEpwq “ n ÿ i“1 ´ yi ´ wT xi ¯2 (2.26) It is an intuitive result – maximization of the likelihood is equivalent to minimization of the estimation error.

The role of Z becomes more clear when equation 2.37 is written in the exponential form: Prpy “ c | xq “ 1 Z exp ´ wT c x ¯ (2.38)",562,125,140.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
145,49,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:34 review of predictive modeling The normalizing factor thus scales the probability distribution. We can estimate Z from the fact that all class probabilities must sum up to one ÿ c Pr py “ c | xq “ 1 (2.39) and, consequently, the normalizing factor can be found by substitut- ing 2.38 into 2.39: Z “ ÿ c exp ´ wT c x ¯ (2.40) By substituting this result back into equation 2.38, we obtain a for- mula for the class probability estimation: Prpy “ c | xq “ exp ` wTc x ˘ ř i exp ` wT i x ˘ (2.41) This probability can be used to deﬁne the log-likelihood, and the co- efﬁcient vectors wi can then be estimated by using numerical methods such as gradient descent. It is important to note that resultant equation 2.41 can be interpreted as a generic method for mapping a vector of real values to a vector of class probabilities, regardless of the underlying model that produces these values. To see this, let us assume that some model, not necessar- ily a linear one, produces a vector of values v, where each value can be interpreted as a relative weight of the corresponding class. These weights are not necessarily normalized as probabilities: values v can be out of the r0, 1s range or may not add up to one.",1208,228,302.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
146,49,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:To map these weights to normalized class probabilities, let us deﬁne a generic function, com- monly known as the softmax function, that repeats equation 2.41 with a vector of real values as a parameter: softmaxpi, vq “ exp pviq ř j exp ` vj ˘ (2.42) The normalized class probabilities can then be acquired by passing the class weights v through the softmax function. We will use this property in the later chapters to construct some predictive models.2.4.3.4 Naive Bayes Classiﬁer The last model that we consider in this section is the Naive Bayes classi- ﬁer. This method is widely used for text classiﬁcation, so it will be very helpful later in building search and recommendation services. Recall that a classiﬁcation problem with multiple classes can be deﬁned as py “ argmax c Prpy “ c | xq (2.43)",802,139,200.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
147,50,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:2.4 supervised learning 35 By applying the Bayes rule to the conditional probability of class c, we get the following equation: Prpy “ c | xq “ Prpx | y “ cqPrpy “ cq Prpxq (2.44) The probability of the feature vector in the denominator is the same for all classes, so it can be discarded for a classiﬁcation problem: py “ argmax c Prpy “ cqPrpx | y “ cq (2.45) The key assumption made by the Naive Bayes classiﬁer is that each feature xi is conditionally independent of every other feature, given the class c. This means that the probability of observing the feature vector x, given the class c, can be factorized as Prpx | y “ cq “ m ź i“1 Prpxi | y “ cq (2.46) in which m is the length of the feature vector. This assumption, called the conditional independence assumption, is rarely true in practical appli- cations, but the Naive Bayes algorithm performs reasonably well in a wide range of such cases. For example, this classiﬁer is successfully used for text classiﬁcation when each feature is a word, although the words in the text are not independent. This can be explained by the fact that the Naive Bayes algorithm can still be correct if the features are dependent, but the dependencies have a certain structure and cancel each other out [Zhang, 2004]. By using the independence assumption, the classiﬁcation problem can be rewritten as py “ argmax c Prpy “ cq m ź i“1 Prpxi | y “ cq (2.47) The parameters of this model are the values Prpy “ cq and Prpxi | y “ cq.",1475,275,368.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
148,50,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:One possible approach to ﬁt the model is to treat these values simply as unknown variables, rather than probabilities, and to maximize the log-likelihood that corresponds to equation 2.47. However, it can be easily shown that this leads to exactly the same results as if we treat the parameters as empirical probabilities. In other words, the maximum likelihood estimate of py in expression 2.47 can be obtained if Prpy “ cq is estimated as the frequency of class c in the training data set and Prpxi | y “ cq is estimated as the frequency of samples that belong to class c and have the feature value xi. This makes it easy to ﬁt the Naive Bayes model in practice.",664,120,166.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
149,51,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:36 review of predictive modeling In the general case, the Naive Bayes classiﬁer is not linear. However, it is linear under certain assumptions that are accurate in many appli- cations, so it is often described as linear. For example, let us consider a case where the distribution Prpx | y “ cq is assumed to be multinomial. This is a valid assumption, for example, for text classiﬁcation when each element of the feature vector is a word counter. The probability of a feature vector follows a multinomial distribution with parameter vector qc Prpx | y “ cq 9 m ź i“1 qxi ci (2.48) in which qci is the probability of the feature value xi occurring in class c. We can rewrite this expression in the vector form as follows: log Prpx | y “ cq “ xT log qc ` constant (2.49) We can now show that the decision boundary between the classes is linear by considering the ratio of class probabilities, similarly to the method we used for logistic regression.",947,172,236.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
150,51,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:By assuming only two classes y P t0, 1u for the sake of simplicity, we can write log Prpy “ 1 | xq Prpy “ 0 | xq “ log Prpy “ 1 | xq ´ log Prpy “ 0 | xq “ xT plog q1 ´ log q0q ` log Prpy “ 1q ´ log Prpy “ 0q (2.50) This is a linear function of x, which means that the decision boundary between the classes is linear.2.4.4 Nonlinear Models Linear methods can be an appropriate solution for many marketing applications and the power of these methods should not be underes- timated, but they can perform poorly on data sets with nonlinear de- pendencies. We need to develop methods that are able to model more complex distributions. This problem can be approached from different perspectives, and we discuss here two major families of methods that are often used in practice. We will discuss a few more methods, such as neural networks, later in the book in the context of speciﬁc application areas.",896,172,224.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The opposite is also true – data sets that are not tractable for linear methods can be become tractable if mapped to a different space.

This transformation of the original feature space into another space, typically of higher dimensionality, is referred to as feature mapping. It is intuitively clear that the addition of more dimensions, speciﬁed as nonlinear functions of one or several existing features, provides more ﬂexibility for a regression or classiﬁcation algorithm that we are trying to improve. However, we need a method to deﬁne the mapping func- tion φpxq that produces a new feature vector of higher dimensionality.",544,84,136.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
154,52,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The ﬁrst thing we have to note is that many regression and classi- ﬁcation methods can be expressed in terms of distances between the input vector and the training vectors. For example, we have shown that coefﬁcients of linear regression can be calculated as w “ pXT Xq´1XT y (2.51) We can multiply this expression by the identity matrix I, which can be expressed as I “ XT XpXT Xq´1 (2.52)",390,71,97.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Equation 2.55 can then be rewritten purely in terms of the kernel function: ypxq “ n ÿ i“1 aikpx, xiq (2.57) In other words, we simply modify the distance function between the feature vectors, as opposed to using the dot product in expression 2.55. Thus, the input vectors do not need to be mapped, but the algorithm should be modiﬁed to use the kernel function instead of the dot prod- uct. The relationship between the kernel function and the mapping function can be illustrated by using a quadratic kernel: kpx, zq “ pxT zq2 (2.58) If the original feature space is two dimensional, the kernel expands it into a three-dimensional space that contains both derivatives of the individual features and cross-products of features that can make the data set tractable for linear methods: kpx, zq “ pxT zq2 “ px1z1 ` x2z2q2 “ x2 1z2 1 ` x2 2z2 2 ` 2x1x2z1z2 “ px2 1, ?2x1x2, x2 2qpz2 1, ?",1504,288,376.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Among the best known members of the kernel methods family are support vector machines (SVMs). The basic SVM algorithms are linear classiﬁcation and regression methods, but they can be efﬁciently ker- nalized to learn nonlinear dependencies.

The kernel function imposes limitations on the shape of the decision boundary, and, although we can try several kernels or kernel parameters to ﬁnd a good ﬁt in practice, we may sometimes be better off by choosing a different approach. We can state the problem of learning a set of q basic functions φipxq so that the response can be predicted as their weighted composition: ypxq “ q ÿ i“1 wiφipxq (2.61) Provided that the basis functions are highly adaptive and nonlinear, we can expect this solution to outperform linear methods in appropri- ate tasks.

This is a restrictive assumption because the feature values have to be jointly normally distributed to ensure statistical independence with zero cor- relation.

This may not be the case for data sets with more complex shapes.2.5.1.2 Dimensionality Reduction The key property of PCA is that the principal vectors are sorted by the variance magnitude. This property is important because one can argue that high-variance dimensions in the data are typically more in- formative and carry a stronger signal than low-variance dimensions. For example, we can say that axes x1 and x2 in Figure 2.8 are equally important and the one-dimensional representations obtained by pro- jecting the data points on x1 or x2 are not good approximations of",800,131,200.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

At the same time, dimen- sions z1 and z2 of the decorrelated data set obtained by using the PCA transformation are not equally important and dimension z2 can be dis- carded with a relatively small loss of information. This property can be used in several ways. The ﬁrst application is dimensionality reduction, in which the m-dimensional data set X needs to be reduced to a k-dimensional data set and k ă m. In the case of PCA, this reduction can be done by using a truncated matrix Vk that includes only the ﬁrst k principal component vectors and calculating a new data representation as Zk “ XVk (2.76) Matrix Zk has only k columns, which correspond to the ﬁrst principal axes.

For example, a consumer decides which of several competing products to buy, whether to cancel their subscrip- tion to a certain service or not, and so on. We can assume that the decision-maker compares the options in a consistent way (if option k is preferable to option m and option m is preferable to n, then k is preferable to n) and chooses the most preferable one, so it is valid to introduce a virtual numerical metric that is proportional to the utility of a given option to the decision-maker.

A model of consumer choice can be created by using the known properties of the individual and the alternatives.

It is useful in applications that deal with extreme events, such as earthquakes, manufacturing defects, and equipment failures.

For example, a product manufacturer may be interested in estimating the share of consumers that can be drawn away from competitors by reducing the product price or launching a new product. The MNL model implies that an increase or decrease in the probability of one alternative will evenly affect all other alternatives. To see this, consider the ratio of any two probabilities: Pni Pnj “ eVniL ř k eVnk eVnjL ř k eVnk “ eVni eVnj “ eVni´Vnj (2.96) The ratio of probabilities depends only on the ratio of the corresponding utilities, a property commonly referred to as independence of irrelevant alternatives; if the utility Vni changes, the pairwise ratios for all other pairs Pnp{Pnq remain constant.

For example, it can be more use- ful for a marketing system to estimate the time until the next purchase or time until subscription cancellation, rather than the probabilities of these events. Second, marketing data very often include records with unknown or missed outcomes, which cannot be properly accounted for in classiﬁcation models. Going back to the example with the sub- scription cancellation, it is often impossible to distinguish between cus- tomers who have not defected and those who have not defected yet because we build a predictive model at a certain point in time and cannot wait indeﬁnitely until the ﬁnal outcomes for all customers are observed.",944,154,236.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A comprehensive framework for time-to-event modeling and incom- plete data handling was originally developed for medical and biolog- ical studies. The main focus of the studies was the survival of indi- viduals after medical treatment, so the framework became known as survival analysis. Let us describe the main methods of this framework by starting with the basic terminology. The main goal of survival anal- ysis is to predict the time to an event of interest and quantitatively explain how this time depends on the properties of the treatment, in- dividuals, and other independent variables.",709,113,177.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

An event is typically a purchase, promotion redemption, subscription cancellation, or any other customer action that a marketer might be in- terested in inﬂuencing. Note that a positive outcome of the treatment can be either acceleration or deceleration of the event, depending on the application. Advertisements, for example, aim to stimulate earlier purchases; meanwhile, retention offers aim to suppress subscription cancellation events. By contrast, medical research typically measures the time from diagnosis to death, so the standard terminology of sur- vival analysis assumes that the event corresponds to some negative outcome, which can be confusing when the opposite is the case.",789,116,197.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

These unknown outcomes can occur because the outcome is not known by the time of the analysis (the customer has not yet purchased but may still purchase in the future) or the customer record has been lost (for example, because of a browser cookie expiration). The records with unknown outcomes are referred to as censored records. By the time of the analysis, we initially have a set of observations, each of which has the time of the treatment and, optionally, the time of the event of interest, as shown in Figure 2.12.

At this point, we are interested only in the distribution of the events and are not trying to explain the dependency between the survival time and the properties of the treatment or customers.2.6.2.1 Survival Function The distribution of survival times can be described in terms of the sur- vival probability, also called the survival function, Sptq, which is deﬁned as the probability that an individual survives from the time origin to time t.

Note that the statistical properties of the survival time, such as the mean, median, and conﬁdence intervals, can be estimated based on the cumulative distribution function. Consequently, these properties can be estimated if an estimate for the survival function is available. The survival function can be estimated from the observed data, by taking into account both censored and uncensored records, based on the assumption that events are independent from each other. In this case, the cumulative survival probability can be obtained by multiply- ing the probabilities for survival from one interval to the next.",1005,172,251.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

On the other hand, the parametric approach smooths noisy data and provides a simple model for the baseline hazard. The second option is to use a nonparametric baseline hazard model that can be estimated from the data by using the Kaplan–Meier esti- mator or other methods.

This makes it very convenient for applications that require only the risk factors to be estimated, not the absolute haz- ard values. The downside of the Cox model is that the baseline hazard needs to be estimated by using parametric methods.

230,81,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:66 review of predictive modeling Our next step is to estimate the parameters of the Cox model from the data. The standard approach to this problem is to derive the like- lihood of the model and then ﬁnd the parameters that maximize it. The challenge, however, is that observations can be censored, which requires us to specify how such records will be accounted for in the likelihood. First, let us note that each observation contributes to the likelihood. If the i-th observation is censored, it contributes the proba- bility of survival up until ti: Lipwq “ S pti | w, xq (2.122) If the observation is not censored, it contributes the probability of the event at ti, which is deﬁned by using the survival time probability density function: Lipwq “ fptiq “ h pti | w, xq S pti | w, xq (2.123) So the full likelihood can be expressed as follows: Lipwq “ k ź i“1 h pti | w, xqδi S pti | w, xq (2.124) We cannot maximize this by using numerical methods without spec- ifying the form of the baseline hazard.",1004,185,251.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
231,81,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:However, it is possible to ap- proximate the full likelihood with a different measure called the par- tial likelihood. First, let us introduce the notion of the risk set at time t, which is deﬁned as the set of individuals who are at risk of the event at time t, that is, those who have not yet experienced the event: Rptq “ ti : ti ě tu (2.125) For simplicity, let us also assume that there are no event ties, that is, all event times ti are distinct1. In this case, the partial likelihood can be deﬁned by using the conditional probability that a particular person i will fail at time ti, given the risk set at that time, and that exactly one failure is going to happen [Cox, 1972, 1975]. This probability is given by the area under the hazard curve for a small time interval dt, so the likelihood contributed by individual i can be expressed as Lipwq “ hpti | w, xiqdt ř j P Rptiq hptj | w, xjqdt (2.126) 1 The case with ties is more complex, but there exist a number of generalizations that account for ties [Breslow, 1974; Efron, 1977].

232,82,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:2.6 more specialized models 67 By inserting the speciﬁcation of Cox model 2.120 into this partial likelihood, we can see that the baseline hazards cancel each other out and we get Lipwq “ exp ` wT xi ˘ ř j P Rptiq exp ` wT xj ˘ (2.127) Finally, the partial likelihood for the entire training data set is a prod- uct of the individual partial likelihoods given by equation 2.127: Lpwq “ k ź i“1 « exp ` wT xi ˘ ř j P Rptiq exp ` wT xj ˘ ﬀδi (2.128) This likelihood does not depend on the hazard function, so we can ﬁt it by using numerical methods with respect to the weights w. This, in turn, enables us to estimate the risk ratios deﬁned by equation 2.121. The ability to estimate the risk ratios without estimating the hazard function is one of the key advantages of the Cox model. Thus far, we have been focused on the estimation of regression weights. Our last step is to specify how the baseline hazard and survival functions can be estimated.

Consequently, it is critically important for a bidder to estimate the value of the item correctly, and we can classify all auction settings by the following valuation types: private value Each bidder evaluates the item independently from other bidders and the estimate does not depend on other bids, even if they are known.interdependent value The actual value is not known to the bid- ders, and, although each bidder has their own estimate of what",939,161,234.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Exam- ples of common value auctions include selling natural resources such as oil or timber, selling ﬁnancial assets such as bonds, or sell- ing a company.

The distinction between the target and non-target groups is often fuzzy and ambiguous because consumers differ in their income, buying behavior, loyalty to a brand, and many other properties. The diversity of customers is often so high that an offering created for an average consumer, that is, for everyone, does not really ﬁt anyone’s needs. This makes it critically important for businesses to identify the most relevant consumers and tailor their offerings on the basis of consumer properties. This problem occurs in virtually all marketing applications, and it plays an especially impor- tant role in advertisements and promotions because the efﬁciency of these services directly depends on the ability to identify the right audi- ence and convey the right message.",938,167,234.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It is critically important that the retailer or agency, as a marketing channel owner, can track consumers at the individual level and link together transactions made by the same consumer or house- hold. This tracking is often based on loyalty IDs that are assigned to the customers by using loyalty cards or online accounts, credit card IDs, or other pieces of information that are available to a re- tailer. This process, however, is often imperfect, and a signiﬁcant number of transactions can remain anonymous. •",779,127,194.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Be- yond these events, a targeting system can also access additional or external consumer data, such as demographic records or survey answers. In the environment described above, the interactions with the con- sumer are often structured as marketing campaigns, which is a conve- nient unit of optimization. We deﬁne a targeted campaign as a market- ing action constrained by a budget or duration that aims to achieve a certain business objective by distributing targeted offerings to existing customers or prospects.

Consequently, the retailer beneﬁts from a collaboration with a manufacturer because of both improved revenues and loyalty effects. This is the reason why most CPG retailers provide promotions as a service to manufacturers.

If we assume that we can quantify this propensity, we can determine the right consumers to communicate with in order to achieve the objective and maximize the gains.

The metric that we would ultimately like to measure is, however, not the total gain, but the incremental impact of the marketing action relative to the no-action alternative. This incremental gain corresponds to the shaded area in Figure 3.4.

These two problems are equally important, and we discuss them separately in the subsequent sections by using the principles of life-cycle-based modeling.3.4.1 Response Modeling Framework The response modeling framework is a simple generic framework that helps to decompose the campaign modeling problem into several sub- routines. This framework can be modiﬁed and extended to accommo- date the complexity of real-life marketing campaigns. We assume a relatively abstract setting in which a brand needs to optimize the dis- tribution of a promotion or some other treatment across a population of consumers by selecting the most promising candidates to receive the treatment in order to maximize the overall value of the campaign.",931,141,232.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
299,104,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:We do not specify the exact meaning of the value at this point, defer- ring this discussion until the following sections, but we assume it to be some quantiﬁable measure that can be compared to costs. The acquisi- tion, maximization, and retention tasks can be considered as variants of this problem. Recall that the basic marketing optimization problem is deﬁned as ﬁnding the strategy that maximizes the value function. In the case of campaign response, we model the overall value of the campaign in terms of the probability of response and the expected net value from a customer. Our subject of optimization will be the set of customers who receive the promotion, that is, the audience of the campaign: Uopt “ argmax UĎP GpUq (3.3) in which P is the entire population of consumers, U is the subset of consumers reached in the scope of the campaign, and GpUq is the expected proﬁt of the campaign, which is a function of the targeting strategy that selects U from P. The expected proﬁt of the campaign can then be modeled as follows: GpUq “ ÿ uPU Pr pR | u, Tq ¨ pG pu | Rq ´ Cq ` p1 ´ Pr pR | u, Tqq ¨ p´Cq (3.4) in which PrpR | u, Tq is the probability of a response to the treatment (promotion) T from customer u, Gpu | Rq is the response net value for customer u, and C is a cost of the promotion resource.",1312,248,328.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The objective is to maximize the expected proﬁt by ﬁnding the subset of customers that are likely to respond in the most proﬁtable way. Equation 3.4 can be reduced as follows GpUq “ ÿ uPU PrpR | u, Tq ¨ Gpu | Rq ´ C “ ÿ uPU E rG | u, Ts ´ C (3.5) in which E rG | u, Ts denotes the expected value for a given con- sumer on the assumption that the consumer will receive the promotion. Consequently, the customer selection criteria can be simpliﬁed to E rG | u, Ts ą C (3.6) because the expected net value is non-negative and all consumers are assumed to be independent. Next, the optimal subset of customers U can be determined as a subset that maximizes the value: argmax UĎP GpUq “ argmax UĎP ÿ uPU E rG | u, Ts ´ C (3.7) Note that this approach can be interpreted as the maximization of the targeted net value relative to random resource distribution.",992,190,248.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It can be argued that the model deﬁned by equation 3.7 is imperfect because it favors consumers who are likely to respond to a promotion but does not take into account customers who are likely to respond anyway, thereby yielding the same proﬁt even without the promotion [Radcliffe and Surry, 1999; Lo, 2002]. Consequently, the actual proﬁt uplift of a promotion campaign in comparison to the no-action base- line can be very small or even negative. Another way to think about this problem is as an experiment in which we divide the set of cus- tomers identiﬁed by targeting equation 3.7 into two groups, send the promotion to one group but not the other, and then compare the out- come from the two groups. It may be the case that customers in the ﬁrst group actively redeem the promotion and purchase the product but that customers in the second group purchase the product equally as much or even more.",1148,196,287.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The alternative approach, known as differential response analysis or uplift modeling, is to maximize the uplift metric, deﬁned as follows uplift “ pG1 ´ G2q ´ pG3 ´ G4q (3.10) which measures not only the lift compared to random distribution but also the lift compared to the no-action baseline for the same set of customers [Berry, 2009].

This approach is consistent with the principles of life-cycle- based targeting and uplift modeling that we stated in the previous section.

Models can be created for different objectives and contexts, and a targeting system often main- tains a repository of models attributed with the corresponding meta- data, so that relevant models can be fetched according to the criteria. For example, one can have a model for acquisition campaigns in the potato chips category and another one for maximization campaigns in the soda drinks category. Models are the basic primitives that can be combined with each other, as well as with other building blocks, to cre- ate more complex programmatic ﬂows.

312,109,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:It should be stressed that a programmatic system can use models both in predictive and prescriptive ways. The most direct application is prediction of consumer properties, such as propensity to respond to an email or expected lifetime proﬁt. Many models, however, express the dependency between inputs and outputs in a relatively transpar- ent way, so the system can contain additional logic that uses this pre- scriptive insight or can at least make some recommendations to the marketer. For instance, the parameters of a regression model that pre- dicts a response can indicate a positive or negative correlation with speciﬁc communication channels or other parameters, and this insight can be used to make additional adjustments, such as limiting the num- ber of communications in the presence of a negative correlation. In this section, we consider three major categories of models that can be used separately or together: propensity models The idea of propensity models is to estimate the probability of a consumer to do a certain action, such a pur- chase of certain product.",1081,173,270.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It is important to provide the ability to aggregate the data at different levels of hierarchical dimensions to ﬁnd the optimal level of granularity.

318,111,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Al- though analysis of ﬁnancial results is important, it is typically a good idea to establish the link between marketing actions and these results through behavioral concepts. For example, a solution that expresses the revenue as a function of advertising intensity is not necessarily insight- ful and actionable enough. A solution that quantiﬁes how advertising inﬂuences customer loyalty and behavioral patterns (e. g., migration from one customer segment to another) and then links customer prop- erties to the revenue is likely to be more insightful and actionable.3.5.2 Tiered Modeling Targeting models score the relevance of a customer for a business objec- tive and context, based on the features derived from a customer proﬁle.

322,112,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:As we discussed earlier, the consumer life cycle is an important consideration for the design of promotional campaigns, so the ability to target individual life-cycle phases is important. The life- cycle phases are characterized by both the total spending in a category and the loyalty to the brand, that is, the relative spending on a brand compared with that on other brands, so we can classify customers into segments by using these two metrics, as shown in Figure 3.10. This ap- proach, known as loyalty–monetary segmentation, is used in traditional manufacturer-sponsored campaigns. Customers who are highly loyal to the brand and spend a lot of money in the category are clearly the most valuable customers, who should be rewarded and retained. Customers who spend a lot in the category but are not loyal to the given brand are the best candidates for trial offers and so on.",881,147,220.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

One possible technique is to sum all three metrics into a single score and select customers whose score ex- ceeds a threshold – this corresponds to cutting a corner away from the RFM cube. RFM analysis is based on the empirical observation that recency, fre- quency, and monetary metrics are often correlated with the probability to respond and the lifetime value. Although this is a fair assumption, the RFM approach is shallow because it measures the ﬁnal outcomes of the marketing processes and consumer actions, not the factors that impact consumer behavior.",710,117,177.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Our next step will be to build more formal scoring models. The goal of propensity modeling is to ﬁnd consumers who have a relatively high probability of behaving in a certain way or committing a certain action in the future.

These habits are generally stable over time, and once a brand manages to change a customer’s level of engagement, this level tends to last. Consequently, brands are generally interested in ﬁnding customers who are open to changing their habits, for example, people who moved from one city to another, graduated a school or university, just married, and so on. The canonical example of such modeling is Target’s attempt to predict customer pregnancies in the early stages because births obviously change the way customers shop [Duhigg, 2012].",911,142,227.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Look-alike modeling is based on the observation that propensity is essentially the probability of a customer moving from one point on the life-cycle curve to another, so one can train a predic- tive model by using proﬁles of consumers who exhibited this behavior in the past and then evaluate the model against the current proﬁle of a given customer to estimate their propensity. For example, the proﬁles of customers who used not to buy a given product for a while and then started to buy it can be used to train a model that identiﬁes customers with a high propensity to try this product for the ﬁrst time.",1062,171,265.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

One possible methodology for creating such models is pi- lot campaigns. The idea of this approach is to distribute a promotion initially to a relatively small group of recipients, collect the responses, and create a classiﬁcation model that maximizes the difference between treated responders and treated non-responders. This corresponds to a look-alike model trained on a population of treated proﬁles by using the response indicator as a training label.

Thus, traditional propensity models are de- signed to identify customers who are likely to respond to a promotion or some other marketing communication. The downside of this ap- proach is that such models can target customers who are likely to take an action anyway, even without the treatment. In other words, it can be the case that the propensity model predicts a high probability of re- sponding, but once the campaign is executed, the observed difference between the test and control groups, that is, the uplift, is insigniﬁcant or the control group could even outperform the test group.",872,146,218.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The problem with the two-model approach is that separately created models may have incomparable score scales and may select features that are not actually predictive for the uplift, so this solution often fails to achieve better results than the baseline non-incremental propensity model [Radcliffe and Surry, 2011; Kane et al.,",881,138,220.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A simplistic example of segment proﬁles is shown in table 3.4.

The ﬁrst issue is that the probability of the event does not straightforwardly translate into the time-until-event, which is usually a more actionable metric.

Similarly to many other problems of marketing analytics and algorithmic market- ing, LTV modeling can be approached from descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive perspectives.

Although we can adjust the time horizon T according to the average customer lifetime, it can be more convenient to include the customer retention rate r into the formula as a parameter.

374,129,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Second, the LTV is typically measured for relatively long time intervals of 2–3 years, so we might need to account for the fact that money in the present is worth more than the same amount in the future, that is, for a discount rate d. The discount rate reﬂects the cost of tying up the capital for a period of time. For example, an annual discount rate of 0.15 means that the present value of $1 should be considered equivalent of $1.15 to be received in one year. Accounting for the discount rate gives the net present value of the LTV. By taking these two factors into account, we can estimate the customer net proﬁt as pR ´ Cq for the ﬁrst time period, pR ´ Cq ¨ r{p1 ` dq for the second time period, and so on, which eventually adds up to the following deﬁnition of the LTV [Berger and Nasr, 1998] : LTVpuq “ Tÿ t“1 pR ´ Cqrt´1 p1 ` dqt´1 (3.23) This formula is widely used and can be considered as a standard deﬁnition of the LTV.

384,133,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This result can be compared to the standard descriptive LTV model in equation 3.23 – we essentially replace the static net proﬁt and retention rate parameters with a time-dependent probabilistic estimate. Let us conclude the example by estimating the LTV for several dif- ferent values of time horizon T. As before, we assume the transition probabilities of p1 “ 0.8, p2 “ 0.4, and p3 “ 0.1. Let us also assume that the expected revenue of one purchase is R “ $100, monthly cost of marketing communications is C “ $5, and monthly discount rate is d “ 0.001.

385,134,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:3.5 building blocks: targeting and ltv models 119 We can see that the LTV heavily depends on the initial customer state. For a time horizon of three months, that is, VT“3, the LTV of a customer who made a purchase a month ago is $184.0. After two months, the expected LTV drops to $53.4, and ﬁnally to $10.5 after the third month. We can extend the Markov chain method to accommodate more com- plex customer states and marketing strategies. For example, the proba- bility of the next purchase is often correlated not only with the recency but also with the frequency of past purchases.",585,104,146.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
386,134,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:In this case, each dis- tinct pair of recency and frequency values can be modeled as a sep- arate state in the chain. We can also replace the algebraic estimation of the LTV given by expression 3.28 with Monte Carlo simulations of the consumer journey, which can provide even more ﬂexibility in how gains and loses are modeled. In this case, we randomly select the ini- tial state according to the state frequencies estimated from the data; we then traverse the graph, ﬂipping a coin in each state to decide in which direction to go and recording the proﬁts and losses encountered on the way. By repeating this process many times, we obtain multiple samples of the expected lifetime value. The advantage of this approach is that the statistical properties of the LTV, such as mean, variance, or con- ﬁdence intervals, can be straightforwardly assessed by analyzing the histogram of obtained samples.",899,152,224.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The limitation of this ap- proach is that the number of states grows exponentially with the num- ber of customer properties that we include in the model. We can take one step back and note that, conceptually, both descriptive and Markov chain models estimate the LTV in terms of the customer’s probability to stay with the brand and the expected net proﬁt from the customer. This can be expressed as follows: LTVpuq “ Tÿ t“1 ppu, tq ¨ mpu, tq (3.30) in which ppu, tq is the probability of customer u staying until time t and mpu, tq is the net proﬁt from the customer in time period t. The conventional descriptive model estimates both factors by using static",1006,170,251.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A more ﬂexible solution for problem 3.30 can be obtained by creating regression mod- els for both factors. The advantage of this approach is that regression models can use a wide range of independent variables created from a customer proﬁle and, thus, enable predictive and prescriptive capabili- ties. One can see that survival analysis is a natural choice for the reten- tion probability factor in equation 3.30. This probability directly corre- sponds to the customer’s survival function Suptq, so the model can be rewritten as LTVpuq “ Tÿ t“1 Suptq ¨ mpu, tq (3.31) The survival model is trained to estimate the time to churn, and it requires the churn event to be deﬁned.",833,136,208.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
389,135,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:These events may be tracked di- rectly (if a customer explicitly unsubscribes from a service) or heuris- tically by using some business rule (for example, all customers with ﬁve or more months without purchase activity are considered lapsed). Survival analysis efﬁciently solves the problem of the retention proba- bility estimation by proper handling of censored data, and the ability to estimate personalizes survival functions parametrized by customer properties, such as recency and frequency of purchases. The net proﬁt values mpu, tq can be estimated in several different ways with different accuracies. One of the most basic approximations is to estimate the average net proﬁt value for each customer segment (persona) and use this static value for all customers within a segment. More elaborate regression models can be created by including season- ality and customer proﬁle features.",892,136,223.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A marketing campaign, however, is typically a ﬂow with multiple ac- tions and decisions geared to achieve a certain objective. This ﬂow may require multiple models to be wired together and optimizations to be done with multiple signals and constraints taken into account. A target- ing system often has some sort of repository for campaign templates, where each template describes a certain ﬂow of actions and decisions.

In this section, we consider several types of campaigns and their relationship to the previously discussed basic models.3.6.1 Customer Journeys From an economic standpoint, interactions between a customer and brand can often be viewed as a collection of transactions that can be characterized in terms of total amounts, purchased items, margins, clicks on the website, and so on. The problem of marketing optimiza- tion can also be viewed in a transaction-centric way so that all compo- nents of the marketing mix become focused on the optimization of in- dividual transactions, in terms of their probabilities and margins. The notion of the customer life cycle puts this optimization into a broader context but still focuses on the brand’s concerns and objectives rather than the customer experience.",1079,171,269.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
392,136,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This approach is incomplete in many marketing environments, including retail, where interactions with a customer are experience-centric and the success of a brand is deter- mined by its ability to deliver a superior long-term customer experi- ence, rather than optimizing individual transactions. One popular approach to customer experience analysis and model- ing is based on the notion of customer journey maps. A journey map tells the story of the relationship between a customer and the brand. The map can describe the entire arc of the engagement, similarly to the life-cycle curve, or can be focused on a speciﬁc scope, such a single purchase. The map is typically visualized as a diagram with the steps or stages of the engagement and the transitions between them.",771,124,192.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This map depicts the ﬂow of a single transaction but puts it in the con- text of the customer experience and long-term interactions with the brand. The journey starts with triggers, which include browsing for a new idea and product, preparation for special events such as birthday par- ties, getting a promotional email, or the necessity to replenish a con- sumable product. The trigger is followed by researching product in- formation and selecting the purchasing channel. The interaction then continues in the scope of the selected channel, including browsing of a speciﬁc product and checkout, and completes with post-purchase ac- tions such as product return or writing a customer review.",768,124,192.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In addition, customer journey maps are often created for each customer segment because the journeys can differ substantially across the segments. A marketing campaign typically has a certain footprint on the jour- ney map, in the sense that a campaign attempts to inﬂuence the path of a customer.

A template can describe a single action or a whole set of ac- tions that can be executed at different points in time, by using different channels, and by taking the observed feedback into account.",622,106,155.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Thus, the creation of customer journeys maps and campaign templates is not the responsibility of a programmatic system. We generally assume that these artifacts are created elsewhere and then entered into the system. The responsibilities of the system, however, include estimation and op- timization of the template parameters and dynamic selection of the most optimal templates.3.6.2 Product Promotion Campaigns One of the most basic types of targeted campaign is a sales promotion for an individual product.",750,110,187.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In the CPG domain, this class of campaign is often referred to as free-standing inserts (FSI), named so because of coupon booklets that are inserted into local news- papers. In the most basic form, a standalone promotion corresponds to a simple customer journey with a trigger (promotion) and purchase (redemption). As we will see later, this approach is not necessarily the most efﬁcient one, but it is applicable to all objectives: • For acquisition, a brand can send BOGO or dollar-off coupons to customers who are heavy category buyers but do not buy this particular brand. •For maximization, a brand can send conditional promotions like Buy 3, Get $1 Off to existing customers. •",840,134,210.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The response modeling framework provides some guidance on how such promotions can be targeted by using predictive models that esti- mate the probability of response, but there are many additional aspects that need to be covered, including the targeting process, budgeting rules, and selection of promotion parameters.3.6.2.1 Targeting Process A targeting system can be used in both batch and real-time modes, depending on the environment and campaign nature.

Other promotions are targeted in near real time because of rapidly changing customer proﬁles or context. For example, a promo- tion may or may not be offered to customers depending on the content of their shopping baskets just before checkout. The real-time approach is generally more ﬂexible, and a properly designed real-time targeting system can also simulate the batch mode by evaluating the targeting rules and models for the entire customer database. Consequently, we focus on the real-time targeting case and consider a process that re- ceives a single customer proﬁle and the corresponding context as the input and produces a list of promotions that should be offered to this customer.",805,129,201.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This database includes promotions from all campaigns that are currently active. Each promotion needs to be attributed with properties such as business objective, promoted product, and category, so the targeting system can use this informa- tion to link the promotion with the proper targeting models and rules. This is the reason why promotion creation and targeting are closely related to each other, in the sense that each targeting step or feature requires a counterpart in the campaign conﬁguration and promotion attributes. We will go though the targeting process and discuss both how promotions are selected from the set of available options and the methodology for creating and attributing promotions with the proper- ties and conditions needed for targeting.",871,136,217.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Some promotions can be temporarily de- activated if the corresponding products are out of stock or un- available through a given marketing channel. The hard-targeting step produces a set of promotions that can poten- tially be offered to a consumer.

Scoring models can be combined with special conditions that complement the logic encapsulated in the model. For instance, the ba- sic look-alike acquisition model identiﬁes customers who are similar to natural triers, but it does not ensure that a promotion will not be of- fered to those who already buy the product.

This step can include several controls to manage differ- ent aspects of a campaign. First, the number of promotions received by a customer in the scope of a single campaign, as well as the total frequency of communications with the customer (number of messages per time unit), should be limited. These rules, often referred to as pres- sure rules or frequency capping rules, typically use thresholds selected heuristically or by means of experimentation.",696,113,174.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
410,141,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Next, the campaign bud- get or the total number of issued promotions is typically limited. The targeting system, however, often needs to determine the optimal num- ber of promotions to maximize the campaign ROI. It can be the case that this number is far below the limit speciﬁed by the marketer and consumption of the budget up to the limit can make losses. From the propensity modeling standpoint, the proﬁtability optimization prob- lem can be viewed as ﬁnding the propensity scoring threshold that maximizes the proﬁt if all customers with a higher score are targeted and all other customers are not. We have already shown how the trade- off between campaign costs and proﬁts can be modeled by using the response modeling framework, and we now consider an example that provides more practical details.",805,134,201.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The average re- sponse rate for this type of campaign and product category estimated from historical data is 2%. On the basis that we have created a propen- sity model that estimates the response probability for each customer, we can score all card holders and sort them by the scores. The result can be summarized by splitting the customers into “buckets” of equal size where the ﬁrst bucket corresponds to the customers with the high- est scores and the last bucket corresponds to those with the lowest scores.",761,129,190.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We use bucketing for the sake of convenience in this example and this approach is often used in practice as well, but there is nothing to stop us from doing the same calculations for individual cus- tomers, that is, having as many buckets as customers. Let us assume that we have 10 buckets or deciles, so that each bucket contains 10,000 customers; consequently, the average expected number of responders is 200 per bucket. In other words, we are likely to get 200 responses from each bucket if we randomly assign customers to buckets.

This suggests that we should use some ﬁxed distribution rate, for example, 100 promotions per hour.

However, it can be argued that this strategy can be inefﬁcient because it has a very short and limited impact on the customer journey [Catalina Marketing, 2014]. It is sometimes possible to design more sophisticated campaigns with multiple phases that inﬂuence the customer journey over a longer period of time.

According to some stud- ies, the acquisition cost per consumer can be 10–20 times higher than the retention or reactivation cost because of lower response rates and other factors [Artun and Levin, 2015].

Thus, the risk of not downloading the application can be recognized and addressed by a dedicated retention campaign.

First, many customers at risk are dissatisﬁed already, and additional communications, especially intrusive ones like phone calls, can catalyze the churn process. Second, some retention commu- nications can remind customers that they have an opportunity to leave, which makes them reconsider their relationship with the brand and look around for alternative options. This makes it important for the communications to be focused and the outcomes to be constantly mea- sured by using control groups.

If the probability to churn and LTV are estimated for a given customer, the product of these two values is the expected loss. We can expect that the ratio between the saved revenues and the cam- paign costs is maximized by treating those customers with the highest expected loss, so this measure can be used as a targeting score: scorepxq “ Prpchurn | N, xq ˆ LTVpxq (3.37) The LTV can be estimated based on the average customer spend or by using the more advanced LTV models described earlier.

Replenishment cam- paigns aim to drive repeat purchases and decrease purchasing cycles by sending reminders, recommendations, and specialized promotions. From the campaign design standpoint, the distinctive features of re- plenishment are the emphasis on communication timing and purchas- ing habits.

The message can be personalized based on the most recently or most frequently purchased products found in the purchasing history. One of the main limitations of the above approach is an estimate of replenishment cycles that is too rough. One possible improvement is to break down the estimate not only by product category but also by customer segment or persona, to account for the differences between customers.",714,115,178.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

More accurate results can be obtained by using survival analysis to estimate the time-to-purchase, as we have already discussed. The survival model also allows the determination of the factors that positively or negatively contribute to the time-to- purchase, such as discounts or replenishment notiﬁcations themselves, so the message content and frequency can be adjusted accordingly.3.7 resource allocation The problem of optimal targeting can be viewed as a resource allo- cation problem where some limited resource, such as sales coupons, needs to be allocated across customers. So far, we have focused only on this type of allocation and have ignored the fact that marketing activi- ties may be required to make many other allocation decisions.",840,131,210.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It can be viewed as the statistical analysis of how the different components of the marketing mix, such as promotions and prices, impact business performance metrics, such as sales and revenues.

The direct mail channel, for example, may have a much higher cost per message than the email channel, but it may provide higher response rates for certain categories of customers. This requires marketing communications to be optimized with respect to channels. One possible approach to this problem is optimization at a customer level, where the channel is selected by using a response model that accounts for channel-speciﬁc response probabilities and costs. Another approach is to optimize the global budget allocation across channels to maximize the revenue.",736,113,184.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

One popular channel mix model that accounts for these effects is the adstock model [Broadbent, 1979].

The effect variable at is called the adstock. The adstock model assumption can then be expressed as at “ xt ` λ ¨ at´1 (3.41) in which λ is the decay parameter that corresponds to the fraction of the effect carried over the time period. For example, a parameter of 0.4 means that the treatment from one period ago has 40 percent of its effect during the current period. In other words, the adstock model assumes that each new marketing activity increases loyalty and aware- ness to the new level, but loyalty gradually fades until it is boosted again by the next portion of activity.",928,167,232.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In fact, the model described by equations 3.42 and 3.43 is known in econometrics as the Koyck distributed lag model, which, in turn, belongs to the family of distributed lag models [Koyck, 1954]. This family provides a number of more ﬂexible alternatives, in- cluding a polynomial distributed lag model, which can be both more ﬂexible and easier to estimate than the Koyck model [Almon, 1965; Hall, 1967].3.7.2 Allocation by Objective A programmatic system can use both LTV growth and acquire– maximize–retain goals as the input objectives for the targeting optimization.

462,158,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:3.7 resource allocation 143 However, the system can provide some guidance on how to allocate budgets across the objectives to maximize the overall ROI [Blattberg and Deighton, 1996]. We have discussed in Section 3.5.7 that the retention rate is a major factor that inﬂuences the LTV, so the LTV can be considered a function of the retention rate. We can make the assumption that the retention rate is, in turn, a function of the marketing budget spent on retention activities. For example, we can model the dependency between the budget and rate as follows: r “ rmax ´ 1 ´ e´krR¯ (3.49) in which R is the retention budget per customer, rmax is an estimate of the maximum retention rate (ceiling) that we can achieve given the unlimited budget, and kr is a coefﬁcient that determines how fast the rate approaches the ceiling. Similarly, we can model the acquisition rate a (response rate for an acquisition campaign) as a function of the acquisition budget: a “ amax ´ 1 ´ e´kaA¯ (3.50) in which A is the acquisition budget per customer, amax is an estimate of the maximum response rate, and ka is a parameter that controls the sensitivity of the rate to budget changes.",1169,205,292.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It is clear that many of these principles hold for other marketing environments, but implementation heavily depends on the available data and exact deﬁnition of business objectives, which can vary across environments. We continue here by analyzing online advertising, which is perhaps the most important and well-developed application of algorithmic marketing and is an excellent example of an environment where the technical infrastructure and data ﬂows are so complicated that the business objectives cannot be understood and achieved without careful examination of the technical capabilities and limitations.3.8.1 Environment The online advertising environment is very complex and diverse be- cause it represents a marketplace where thousands of companies sell and buy ad inventory, offer and utilize technical systems that automate the buying process, and control and measure the quality and effective- ness of advertising campaigns. Additional complexity comes from the fact that, although most of the terminology and standard offers are generally accepted across the industry, there are many variations and cross-cutting solutions that appear as the industry evolves.",1391,197,347.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Figure 3.25 depicts the relationships between the following key enti- ties that constitute the online advertising landscape: • A brand, also commonly referred to as a marketer, is a seller of products or services. The brand invests money into advertising campaigns and expects to obtain a return on the investments by improving certain aspects of sales and customer relationships. •An advertiser or agency runs advertising campaigns on behalf of the brand.

A typi- cal example is internet users who visited the brand’s website one or more times but did not convert. These primary objectives can be complemented by additional con- straints that are important for the brand. For example, the brand might not be willing to advertise on websites with adult, violent, or hateful content.

In other words, the metrics should answer the question “What will happen with the business objective if the advertiser is removed?”Note that this question directly relates to the uplift modeling discussed earlier in this chapter. •It should be possible to answer the above question about adver- tiser removal for the case of multiple advertisers working for the same brand.",799,127,199.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to deﬁne a contract that fully meets the above criteria. The business objectives can be formalized in different ways, and the measurement of the incremental value also rep- resents a non-trivial statistical and technical problem. Let us ﬁrst de- scribe several basic methods that are widely used in practice, and we will then discuss the outstanding questions and limitations that should be addressed in later sections. From the brand perspective, the overall effectiveness of the campaign can be measured by using the cost per acquisition (CPA), which is de- ﬁned as the total cost of the campaign Ccamp divided by the total num- ber of conversions Nconv: CPA “ Ccamp Nconv (3.53) Conversion, however, can be deﬁned in different ways.",889,141,222.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A more simple method is to count the immediate clicks on advertise- ments, which is referred to as the cost per click (CPC) model. From the advertiser perspective, it makes sense to split the cost of the campaign into a product of the number of impressions and the average cost of one impression, so the CPA metric can be expressed as follows: CPA “ Nimpr ¨ E ” cimpr ı Nconv “ 1 CR ¨ E ” cimpr ı (3.54) in which Nimpr is the total number of impressions delivered by the campaign, E ” cimpr ı is the average price paid by the brand for one impression, and CR is the conversion rate. The advertiser’s margin is the difference between the price paid by the brand and the bid value placed in the RTB, so we can deﬁne the advertiser’s equivalent of the CPA as follows: CPAa “ 1 CR ¨ E ” cimpr ´ cbid ı (3.55) We need to specify contracts for cimpr and cbid in order to evaluate the above expressions for CPA and CPAa. The price cimpr paid by the brand is typically ﬁxed, although there are two different types of con- tracts that are used in practice: • Cost per action , also known as cost per acquisition (CPA) or pay per acquisition (PPA), contract.",1323,249,330.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Both approaches are equivalent in the sense that the advertiser has to minimize the CPA metric to satisfy the client, even for CPM con- tacts. The ﬁxed fee implies that the CPA metric in equation 3.54 can be optimized by maximization of the conversion rate CR.",493,85,123.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The ﬁnal area we need to cover is attribution in the case of multi- ple advertisers. The most basic approach is last-touch attribution (LT), which gives all the credit to the last impression that preceded the con- version. Consequently, the goal of the advertiser under the LT model is to identify customers who are likely to convert immediately after the impression.",549,92,137.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
477,164,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:3.8 online advertisements 149 The CPA and LT assumptions – we will refer to these settings as the CPA-LT model – provide a reasonably complete and formal problem deﬁnition that can be used for targeting process optimization. However, the CPA-LT model is overly simplistic and has a number of issues and limitations: • There is no explicit relationship with the business objective. The model does not distinguish acquisition, awareness, or retargeting goals. In fact, CPA-LT principles are geared towards consumers with a high propensity to purchase, which implies a heavy bias towards retargeting and tactical acquisition rather than aware- ness and strategic acquisition. •The model suggests optimization of the response, not uplift.",734,112,183.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
478,164,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This can lead to meaningless results under certain circumstances. For example, a targeting method that identiﬁes only high-propensity users who are likely to convert without any impressions will have a very good performance under the CPA-LT model, although this is unlikely to be a good approach from the ROI standpoint. •Last-touch attribution encourages advertisers to cheat and pig- gyback on each other’s efforts. For example, an advertiser can buy a lot of low-quality inventory, such as ad slots at the bot- tom of web pages, to “touch” as many use users as possible (the so-called carpet bombing). We will discuss how to optimize targeting and bidding strategies under the CPA-LT model in the next section, and we will then investi- gate how the shortcomings of this model can be addressed with more sophisticated attribution and controlled experiments.",860,137,215.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
479,164,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:3.8.3 Targeting for the CPA-LT Model The basic goal of targeting under the CPA-LT model is to identify users who are likely to convert shortly after the impression. Similarly to the case of promotion targeting, we use a variant of look-alike modeling to solve this problem, but we want to explicitly account for the informa- tion about a user’s response to advertisements as opposed to selecting natural buyers based on purchase histories. In particular, we want to account for the performance of the currently running advertisement, which means that we have to dynamically adjust our targeting method based on the observed results.

This approach, however, is not optimal because conversion events are very rare in the case of random targeting and the dimensionality of user proﬁles, as discussed above, is very high, so the creation of a suf- ﬁcient training data set by using random bidding at the beginning of a campaign can be impractically expensive [Dalessandro et al.,2012a].

Marketers typically cannot strictly prove the effectiveness of the action, but they can try to arrange an experiment or analyze the collected data in such a way that the actions in question and the outcomes are properly isolated, so that the causal effect cannot be attributed to external factors. This can be considered as proof of a statistically signiﬁcant causal relationship between the actions and outcomes.

Based on the assump- tion that the total number of individuals who received a treatment n is known and the number of converted individuals k among these n recipients is measured, we can estimate the conversion rate as R “ k n (3.68) The obtained estimate may or may not be statistically reliable, depend- ing on the number of individuals and conversions.

Although it is not necessarily the most simple solution for the most basic problems, it helps us to establish a framework that can be efﬁciently extended for the more complex scenarios that we will consider later on. Because the total number of promotions n is a non-random value chosen before the experiment, our goal is to understand the distribu- tion of the conversion rate given the observed number of conversions ppR | kq. If this distribution is known, we will be able to estimate the probability that the results of hypothetical repeated experiments would deviate signiﬁcantly from the observed value and thus measure the re- liability of the estimated rate. According to Bayes rule, the distribution in question can be decomposed as follows: ppR | kq “ ppk | RqppRq ppkq (3.69) in which ppk | Rq is the likelihood, that is, the probability, of observing k conversions given that the conversion rate value is known to be R, and ppRq is the prior distribution of conversion rates.",1175,196,293.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The posterior distribution ppR | kq is obtained by updating our belief based on the evidence that we see. As the posterior rate distribution includes two factors, ppk | Rq and ppRq, we need to specify these two distributions.

We can denote this constant as cpn, kq and obtain ppR | kq “ Rkp1 ´ Rqn´k ¨ cpn, kq (3.72) This distribution is known as a beta distribution, and there is a stan- dard notation for it.

The question is how to decompose the distribution Prpz, a, y, sq to make it computationally tractable. The graphical model in Figure 3.32 makes certain assumptions that can be used for decomposition : Z and S are considered independent because randomization must not be inﬂuenced by external factors, and Z and Y are conditionally inde- pendent given A and S because conversions can be inﬂuenced only through events A. This leads to the following decomposition of the probability density: Prpz, a, y, sq “ Prpzq Prpaq Prpa | z, sq Prpy | a, sq (3.84) We now need to specify the state random variable S and its role in the densities Prpa | z, sq and Prpy | a, sq. The idea behind the latent fac- tors is to capture “the state of the world” that is not observed directly but can inﬂuence outcomes like the uplift. This concept can be consid- ered as a counterpart of the potential outcomes that we discussed at the beginning of this section, because if we can infer the state from the observations then we can evaluate the potential outcomes for different preconditions.

From a campaign efﬁciency standpoint, we are interested mainly in two properties of the user: compliance with the advertising method (ability or inability to win a bid) and response to the advertisement (converted or not).

An equally important counterpart of targeting is product discovery, that is, the task of providing customers with convenient services and interfaces for browsing the assortment and searching for the products they need. Targeting and discovery services are the two principal programmatic marketing tools that can be leveraged to improve different aspects of customer awareness of a product, service, or brand. The product discovery problem revolves around the notion of pur- chasing intent. In some cases, customers can explicitly express their in- tent by entering a search query or specifying desired product attributes in a different way.",781,123,195.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
563,194,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:In other cases, the intent is not explicitly expressed, and a programmatic service has to infer it from known customer at- tributes and behavior. These two scenarios are often distinguished and thought of as two different categories of services – search services help customers to ﬁnd products that meet explicitly expressed requirements, whereas recommendation services do not require users to express their search intent in order to make suggestions. However, the boundary be- tween search and recommendations is blurry. A basic search service can use only an explicitly entered query to ﬁnd products.

568,195,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Let us consider a few major examples: web search The web is a collection of web pages that contain tex- tual and media information, so it is not surprising that the web search has initially been approached as a text analysis problem. The scoring criteria of the ﬁrst search engines were primarily based on the page content, which created a lot of opportunities for website owners to cheat the system by tampering with hid-",422,74,105.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The search engines were forced to develop a totally new strategy that used cross-references between websites and their trustworthiness as the main scoring signal, so web domains and pages that are ref- erenced by hyperlinks from trustworthy and popular sites are scored highly and the relevance of non-referenced resources is sharply discounted. This approach, pioneered by Google as a PageRank algorithm, became an important distinguishing fea- ture of web search in comparison with most other search envi- ronments. The large scale of the web and necessity of indexing enormous amounts of data has also inﬂuenced web search meth- ods to a very signiﬁcant extent.merchandising search In many search applications, organic relevance is complemented or overridden by business rules that ensure business objectives and constraints are met.",907,135,226.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
570,196,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:A prominent example of such environments is the merchandising-oriented search, which can be found in eCommerce, retail, and other consumer applications, such as hotel booking or restaurant search services.

Merchan- dising search should also take into account domain-speciﬁc terminology and usage patterns to recognize the user’s intent and common idioms.expert search A large number of search services and applications in the law, medicine, research, and industry domains fall into the category of expert search.

For example, it can be critical for a lawyer or patent professional to ﬁnd and examine every docu- ment relevant to the topic in question, whereas merchandising or web search users are typically interested in a few of the most rel- evant results. An expert search is also referred to as an enterprise search in certain contexts. Despite all these dissimilarities, search solutions for different do- mains share many common principles and methods.

In other words, the input of a search service is assumed to be made up of the pair of query and context, and the output is a list of entities in order from the most relevant to the least rele- vant. This basic functionality can be complemented by additional search tools and features that we will discuss in detail later on.

This information can be fed into the rele- vance tuning process that adjusts the relevance controls to meet the objectives. The environment we deﬁned above is focused exclusively on a free- text search where a user enters some free text into a form and gets back a ranked list of results. In a real-world search system such as an eCom- merce website, this basic functionality is often extended with many additional tools and capabilities including facets, automatic query com- pletion, and result sorting options.",759,119,189.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
575,198,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The core functionality of a search service almost completely depends upon the notion of relevance, that is, the differentiation between relevant and non-relevant items. We will spend most of this chapter discussing different and numerous aspects of this question. Our ﬁrst step will be to explore how relevance can be related to economic objectives and measured.4.2 business objectives It is often said that the main objective of a search service is to un- derstand the user’s intent and deliver results that are relevant to this intent. Although this is generally true (and already very challenging to achieve), this view of the objective is limited and does not reﬂect many criteria that are important for a good search service.",730,118,182.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
576,198,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:We can attempt to build a more comprehensive framework by using the basic proﬁt equa- tion as a starting point. Consider an online retailer who sells a certain assortment of products, so the total proﬁt can be expressed as G “ ÿ j qj ` pj ´ vj ˘ (4.1) in which j iterates over all products, q is the quantity sold, p is the price, and v stands for variable costs, which can include whole- sale price and distribution costs. Although we cannot formally connect equation 4.1 to an intangible concept such as user intent, we can make a few heuristic assumptions that help to establish this link and work well in practice. First, we can assume that all quantities sold qj are roughly propor- tional to the organic relevance and overall ergonomics of a search ser- vice. That is, given that the number of search users is ﬁxed, poor rel- evance leads to a relatively large fraction of users who cannot ﬁnd products that match their purchasing intent, whereas good relevance leads to a relatively low fraction of users who are not able to ﬁnd the",1039,188,259.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
577,199,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:184 search right product. Consequently, relevance can be viewed as a plain multi- plicative coefﬁcient for the proﬁt. The second opportunity that becomes apparent from equation 4.1 is that we can try to redistribute quantities qj to sell more high-margin products at the expense of the low-margin ones. We can exploit the fact that purchasing intents typically exhibit some ﬂexibility: a customer might initially be looking to purchase one product but willing to sub- stitute it with a different one, or they might simply browse available offerings with a broadly deﬁned intent and accept the ﬁrst suitable one. Given the ﬁxed number of search users, we can promote high-margin products by boosting them in the search results to capture as many potential buyers as possible and, consequently, by pushing down those products with low margins, thereby negatively inﬂuencing their sale volumes.",891,141,222.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
578,199,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:It is important to note that we can account not only for the margin (the difference between the cost of a product and its selling price) but also for the costs of alternatives associated with a product. For example, fashion retailers often practice clearance sales at the end of a season to free up space for the new collection, so the promotion of expiring products also becomes an objective. We already stated that relevance is directly related to the total proﬁt because it inﬂuences the number of conversions. We should, however, pay more attention to the negative effects associated with relevance and ergonomics defects. From the user viewpoint, the search process includes multiple steps, such as making an initial query, browsing and checking suggested results, query reformatting, and so on.",800,130,200.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
579,199,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Poor rel- evance or ergonomics can force users to repeat searches many times, which may or may not negatively impact conversion rates but is likely to create a negative user experience and, in the long run, to decrease the total number of users; this translates into a lower total quantity sold, according to equation 4.1. The bottom line is that the objectives of a search service and its qual- ity can be viewed, at least, from the following three standpoints: 1. Relevance 2. Merchandising controls 3. Ergonomics and customer satisfaction We discuss each of these three aspects in the subsequent sections and then delve into the implementation details to see how a search service can achieve these goals.",707,118,176.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The search intent, typically re- ferred to as the information need in information retrieval texts, cannot be completely formalized in most applications, especially in merchandis- ing, so the standard way to measure relevance is an expert assessment of the search results to classify each item as relevant or irrelevant. For example, relevant search results for the query sore throat treatments can be subjectively deﬁned as remedies for this symptom ranging from hot tea to medications, not merely a set of items containing the words from the query. We will assume for now that the relevancy grades are set by experts from the search service team, but, as we will see later in this chapter, a search system can collect and analyze certain metrics about user behavior, such as click rates for items in the result set, to automatically estimate relevancy. Let us consider an ideal case, when we are assessing a single pair of a search request and the result, and the total number of items is small enough to be manually classiﬁed.",1197,201,299.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
581,200,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:We can deﬁne the following three values: D is the total number of items relevant for a given intent indexed in the system, S is the number of items in the search result set, and R is the number of relevant items in the result set. The relationship between these three values is shown in Figure 4.2. The quality of search results can then be measured in terms of two metrics, precision and recall, deﬁned as follows: precision “ R S (4.2) recall “ R D (4.3) We typically need both of these metrics to describe the result set or search method. On the one hand, recall measures the completeness of the search results regardless of the result set size, so one can always achieve the maximum possible recall of 1.00 by returning the entire collection of items. On the other hand, precision measures the density of relevant items in the result set and tells us nothing about the relevant items that have not been fetched.",915,166,228.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
582,200,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The difference between the two metrics, however, does not mean that they are independent. First, let us review Figure 4.2 again. It sug- gests that we can change the recall from 0 to 1 by stretching the search results rectangle in the vertical direction; meanwhile, the precision re- mains constant. This behavior is almost never the case for real data.",353,60,88.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

One of the main reasons is that we describe items and specify queries by using dimensions that are not necessarily aligned with the shape of the item set deﬁned by the search intent. Let us consider the example depicted in Figure 4.3. A retailer has a large collection of shoes that are described by using properties such as price and category. A user who searches for affordable quality shoes might consider items scattered along the diagonal from inexpensive dress shoes to expensive sandals to be generally relevant.",690,112,172.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
584,201,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:A search system, however, might not be able to re- peat this shape. If it treats the terms affordable and shoes in a strict way, it can achieve high precision but relatively low recall by returning, for example, average running shoes. Loosening of the criteria increases the recall but also scoops irrelevant items, such as expensive dress shoes, which decreases the precision1. This pattern is almost constantly present in search applications, so we typically have to choose between high-precision, low-recall search methods and the low-precision, high-recall alternatives. Merchandis- ing search is heavily biased towards high-precision search methods be- cause the primary goal is to provide a user with a reasonable number of relevant results that can quickly be reviewed.",776,119,194.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

First, precision and recall are set-based metrics that cannot be straight- forwardly applied to ranked search results. This limitation is critical for merchandising search that strives to provide the user with a few valu- able results sorted by relevance. One possible approach to account for ranking is to go through the items in the result set from top to bottom, 1 This problem is not speciﬁc for search and often comes up in machine learning, especially in deep-learning applications.

Continuing this process, we get a precision of 1⁄4 and recall of 1.00 at the twentieth item in the result set. The precision–recall curve is thus jagged but typically has a downward-sloping concave trend. The precision–recall curve provides a convenient way to analyze search quality for a single query, but we often need a compact metric that expresses the overall performance of a search service as a single number. One standard way to do this is to determine the mean average precision (MAP), which ﬁrst averages the precisions at each relevant item and then averages this value over all of the queries we use in the evaluation.",748,129,187.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The solid circles correspond to relevant items and the empty circles correspond to irrelevant items in the result set.

Consequently, the average precision above is often calculated not for all of the items relevant for a query but for the relevant items in the result set on the basis that the size of the result set is ﬁxed [Manning et al.,2008].",1218,233,304.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
590,203,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:A popular alternative to MAP is discounted cumulative gain (DCG), which abandons the notion of precision and recall completely and gives center stage to ranking [Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2000]. Let us consider a search result that contains K items with each item graded with a relevance value R, so we have K relevance grades Rk. The rele- vance values can be binary (one for relevant and zero for nonrelevant",409,69,102.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The cumulative gain of the result is deﬁned as the sum of the relevance grades: CG “ K ÿ k“1 Rk (4.6) Cumulative gain is similar to precision, given that K is ﬁxed, but it allows the differentiation of documents based on their usefulness by setting multilevel grades R. This is the reason why the metric is called cumulative gain – it attempts to assess the usefulness of the search re- sult. The shortcoming of cumulative gain is that it does not include the order of the items in the consideration, so changes in the ordering of search results do not affect the gain value. This can be ﬁxed by pe- nalizing for relevant results appearing low in a search results list, that is, relevance grades are discounted proportionally to their positions in the list. This leads to the notion of DCG, which uses a logarithm of the result position as a discounting weight: DCG “ R1 ` K ÿ k“2 Rk log2 pkq (4.7) It is more common, however, to use a slightly different deﬁnition of DCG that strongly emphasizes relevant items by assigning them exponentially high weights [Burges et al.,",1155,204,288.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

To compare DCG metrics obtained for different queries, we need to normalize them. This can be done by calculating the maximum possible DCG, called the Ideal DCG, and dividing the actual DCG by this value to obtain the normalized DCG (NDCG): NDCG “ DCG Ideal DCG (4.9) The ideal DCG can be estimated by sorting the items in a search results list by relevance grades and applying formula 4.8 to calculate the corresponding DCG. Consequently, the NCDG is equal to one for an ideal ranking. For example, let us consider a search results list with six items that are scored by an expert on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 meaning nonrelevant and 4 meaning most relevant: 4, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1 (4.10)",839,159,209.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The ideal ordering for this search result is 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 (4.11) and the corresponding ideal DCG is 29.64. Consequently, the NDCG for search results list 4.10 is 28.56/29.64 = 0.96.4.2.2 Merchandising Controls Merchandising controls are tools that enable merchandisers and other business users to reshape search results in accordance with business needs not covered by organic relevance. The boundary between merchandising controls and relevance, however, is very blurry because many business rules can be viewed as enhancements of content-based relevance and, conversely, many relevance tuning methods can be viewed as business rules that improve the search results by adding some domain knowledge.",810,125,202.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
594,205,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:For example, a merchandiser can create a trigger that redirects all users who enter the query insulated jackets to a manually curated category for seasonal jacket sales. On the one hand, this aims to achieve the business goal of promoting products that are on sale. On the other hand, it can be argued that this manually curated content is a better match for the user’s search intent than a standard search result. Most search systems provide a rich toolkit of merchandising controls that can include the following capabilities: boost and bury As we will see in the next sections, organic rel- evance is typically calculated by matching different item and query properties, mixing the resulting scores together, and rank- ing the items by the ﬁnal score. A merchandiser can adjust or override this logic by tweaking relevancy scores in a way that promotes desirable items and demotes undesirable ones.",901,149,225.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It is important not only to provide users with relevant search results but also to present the available assortment in the best possible way, given that display space is limited. For example, it might be beneﬁcial to replace closely related products or product variants, such as different sizes and colors of the same model of jeans, by a single represen- tative to free up more space for other models and avoid cluttering the search results with similar items. From an economic standpoint, some merchandising controls can be viewed as market segmentation techniques. Consider the example of boosting high-margin or luxury products: it is essentially an attempt to segment customers by their price sensitivity, so price-insensitive customers spend little effort picking high-margin items at the top and price-sensitive customers have to spend more time going through pages of results to ﬁnd a better value price.",1014,160,253.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Let us review a few key performance indicators that are often collected for search services: conversion rate Conversion rate is by far the most important per- formance indicator for merchandising search. It can be deﬁned as the ratio of user sessions that used the search service and con- verted to the total number of user sessions that used the search service. A user session is typically equivalent to a web session in this context. The conversion rate is a critically important metric because it is directly related to revenues and the user’s ability to ﬁnd the desired products.,608,101,152.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We will return to the question of relevance tuning, including both manual and automatic tuning processes, in section 4.7, but we ﬁrst need to delve into the details of relevance scoring.4.3 building blocks: matching and ranking The search relevance problem can be considered as a classiﬁcation problem because it aims to distinguish relevant items from nonrelevant ones.",704,108,176.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
603,208,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:At the same time, it is a very special case of classiﬁcation because of its focus on textual data and ranking. These features enable very ef- ﬁcient heuristic methods that can achieve excellent relevance without training a classiﬁer by using machine learning techniques. Although the machine learning approach is also possible (and we will discuss it in the next sections), the basic matching and ranking methods are sufﬁcient for most merchandising search applications and also provide a solid methodology for feature engineering in cases when machine learning methods are applied. We will spend this section reviewing basic search methods that can later be assembled into more compli- cated and comprehensive relevance solutions that may or may not use machine learning for parameter tuning. At a very high-level, we can describe a search as a calculation of some similarity metric between an item and a query, so all items can be ranked according to this metric or excluded from the search result set.",1004,162,251.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
604,208,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Similarly to other classiﬁcation problems, this requires the repre- sentation of an item, a query, and, optionally, other pieces of contextual information, such as user proﬁle details, as features and then the calcu- lation of one or more scores, which we will call signals hereafter, that indicate how well the item features match the query features. The sig- nals are later combined together to make a ﬁnal decision about whether an item should be included in the result list (matching) and about its position in the list (ranking). Figure 4.5 illustrates this ﬂow. Consequently, the designer of a search service has to address multi- ple controls at each of these stages: how to engineer features out of the raw data, how to match the features to produce signals, and how to mix signals together to achieve good relevance. Let us start to consider these controls with a few basic techniques and then gradually increase the complexity by chaining multiple blocks together and adding more variables into the equation.",1018,168,254.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The data can also contain a signiﬁcant amount of structural information, such as a category hierarchy and different size/color product variants associated with one logical product. Let us put this complexity aside for a moment and consider the simple case of a retailer who represents each product as a document with a sin- gle description ﬁeld that contains plain text, so an example with two products would be as follows: Product 1 Description: Pleated black dress. Lightweight look for the office.",765,122,191.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
606,209,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Product 2 Description: Fiery red dress. A black ribbon at the waist. The most basic thing we can do to search over such documents is to break the descriptions up into words and allow only for single-word search queries, so a product will be included in a result set only if its description contains the same word as the query. The process of breaking up a text into words or other elements such as phrases is called tokenization, and the outputs – words in our cases – are called tokens. For English language, tokenization is usually done by using spaces and punctuation marks as delimiters, so the documents above will produce the following tokens: Product 1: [Pleated], [black], [dress], [Lightweight], [look], [for], [the], [office] Product 2: [Fiery], [red], [dress], [A], [black] [ribbon], [at], [the], [waist] (4.14) Consequently, the query black will match both products and the query red will only match the second product.",931,154,232.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Although this token matching method is extremely simple and lim- ited, it illustrates the main search controls that we discussed earlier. First, each token can be viewed as an individual feature that may or may not be present in a product. The tokenization process is then an example of feature engineering. Words are indeed reasonably good fea- tures because they carry a strong signal about a product type, such as shoes, and its properties, such as a black color.",596,101,149.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The ﬁrst enhance- ment that helps us to work around this limitation is the Boolean query, which enables chaining of multiple tokens by using Boolean opera- tions, namely, AND, OR, and NOT. For example, the following Boolean query dress AND red will match only the second product from example 4.14, whereas the query dress AND (red OR black)",529,91,132.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Boolean queries do not take into account positions of tokens in the text and, hence, can be thought of as several token matching queries combined together. The second important capability that extends basic token matching is the phrase query. A phrase query is a query that searches for documents that contain a sequence of tokens that follow one another, as opposed to a Boolean query, which searches for documents that contain individ- ual tokens irrespective of their order and positions in the text. We use square brackets to denote phrase queries and subqueries.",604,99,151.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
611,211,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:For instance, the following query will match the ﬁrst product from example 4.14 but not the second one: [black dress] This result has higher precision and lower recall than the result of the Boolean query black AND dress, which matches both products. Boolean and phrase queries together provide very powerful tools to control relevancy and manage the precision–recall trade-off. A query language that directly supports Boolean expressions is often a good solution for expert search where users are willing to learn and use advanced search functions, but its usage in merchandising search is limited because of the unintuitive user experience. We will discuss how free-text search can take advantage of complex Boolean and phrase queries in the later sections.4.3.3 Normalization and Stemming It is not difﬁcult to see that chopping a text into tokens produces re- sults that are not optimal from a matching standpoint.",918,145,229.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Some words do not carry any meaningful information at all and generate noise signals. This suggests that we need to perform a normalization of the raw to- kens to create a cleaner token vocabulary. Such normalized tokens are typically referred to as terms. Normalization is a complex process that usually includes multiple steps to address the different properties and phenomena of natural language.",541,85,135.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

These premium jeans come in a slim fit for a fashionable look. The ﬁrst step is to normalize the character set because a search query can be entered with or without diacritics and this difference typically,371,61,92.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Tokenizing the text and con- verting it to a standard character set, we get the tokens [Maison] [Kitsune] [Men’s] [Slim] [Jeans] [These] [premium] [jeans] [come] [in] [a] [slim] [fit] [for] [a] [fashionable] [look] The second issue that we face is the presence of lower- and uppercase characters that are also indistinguishable in most cases. The standard approach is to transform each token into its lowercase form, which gives the following result for our example: [maison] [kitsune] [men’s] [slim] [jeans] [these] [premium] [jeans] [come] [in] [a] [slim] [fit] [for] [a] [fashionable] [look] The third possible step is to exclude high-frequency tokens such as and, to, the, and will because they are present in most texts and, hence, do not carry any speciﬁc information about an item. Such tokens are commonly known as stop words. Applying this transformation to the example, we get [maison] [kitsune] [men’s] [slim] [jeans] [premium] [jeans] [come] [slim] [fit] [fashionable] [look] The exclusion of stop words may have both positive and negative implications.",1151,178,287.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

On the other hand, the removal of stop words can result in losses of substantial information and reduce our ability to search for certain queries. For example, the removal of stop words prevents us from ﬁnding phrases like to be, or not to be or distinguishing new from not new. Stop words can also destroy the semantic relationships be- tween the entities, so it becomes impossible to distinguish between an object on the table and under the table. The fourth standard normalization technique is stemming.",705,116,176.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
616,212,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:In most natural languages, words can change their form depending on number (dress and dresses), tense (look and looked), possession (men and men’s), and other factors. Stemming is a process of reducing different word forms to the same root in order to eliminate differences that typically relate to the same search intent. The problem of stemming is challeng- ing because of the multiple exceptions and special cases that can be found in natural languages. There exist multiple stemming methods, ei- ther rule based or dictionary based, with different strengths and weak- nesses. One popular family of rule-based stemmers is based on the so-called Porter stemmer [Porter, 1980].",678,107,169.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

By applying stemming to our sample product description, we obtain the ﬁnal set of regular terms, which looks more condensed and focused on the key features than the original text: [maison] [kitsun] [men] [slim] [jean] [premium] [jean] [com] [slim] [fit] [fashion] [look] Rule Example ...ational −Ñ ate relational −Ñ relate ...tional −Ñ tion conditional −Ñ condition rational −Ñ rational ...ful −Ñ none hopeful −Ñ hope ...ness −Ñ none goodness −Ñ good ...izer −Ñ ize digitizer −Ñ digitize Table 4.1: An example of the rules used in the Porter stemmer. All rules in this example require at least one switch from vowel to consonant in front of the sufﬁx, so the second rule applies to the word conditional but not to rational. The same set of normalization algorithms is typically applied to both the query and documents to map all tokens into the same space of terms. For example, the query Fashionable will match a product that contains fashioned in the description because both words will be mapped to the term fashion.",1088,184,272.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

However, the number of matching and potentially relevant items often exceeds the relatively small number of results that the average merchandising search user will look through, so the order in which items are presented to the user becomes critically important. We need to deﬁne a building block that can rank items according to their relevance. Although ranking cannot improve the global precision–recall prop- erties of the underlying matching, it can be considered a trick that improves precision–recall in the sense of local or perceived qualities. On the one hand, ranking increases the precision of the top results by boosting relevant items, but, at the same time, it does not remove items from the search results list, so it provides the same recall.",912,149,228.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
619,214,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:4.3 building blocks: matching and ranking 199 We can take a ﬁrst step towards ranking by taking a closer look at Boolean queries and recognizing their scoring potential. First, we can notice that both item documents and queries can be represented as binary vectors, such that each element of a vector indicates whether a document or a query contains a certain term or not. In other words, an element that corresponds to a certain term is equal to one if a document or query contains the term and zero otherwise. If the total number of distinct terms in all documents in a collection is n, each document or query is a binary vector with n elements. It is easy to see that a Boolean query can be expressed by using a dot product between query vector q and document vector d. Recall that a dot product between two vectors is given by d ¨ q “ n ÿ i“1 qidi (4.15) and the Euclidean norm of a vector is deﬁned as ∥d∥ “ b d2 1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` d2n (4.16) Consequently, we can say that a Boolean query that contains multiple terms chained by using the AND operator is equivalent to the following condition: d ¨ q ě ∥q∥2 (4.17) because all terms in the query must match corresponding terms in the document, which results in a dot product that equals the number of one elements in the query vector.",1281,243,320.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
620,214,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:A Boolean query that chains its terms with OR is equivalent to the condition d ¨ q ě 1 (4.18) because at least one term must match. This interpretation of Boolean queries reveals a kind of internal scoring that is converted into a match- ing decision by using a threshold. Equations 4.17 and 4.18 also suggest that the ratio between the dot product and query norm can be used as a continuous measure of similarity between the document and query. We can go even further and ask why we don’t account for the norm of a document as well. One can argue that a short document that matches query terms is more relevant than a long document that matches the same number of terms.,671,124,167.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
621,214,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This can be justiﬁed from a probabilistic stand- point in the following way.

A cosine similarity of zero means that a document vector is orthogonal to a query vector in the space of terms, and a simi- larity value of one means an exact match equivalent to a Boolean query. Unlike a Boolean query, the cosine similarity does not require opera- tions to be speciﬁed in a query – it treats both query and document as an unordered collection of terms.

The ﬁrst issue described above can be mitigated by replacing the zeros and ones in the document vectors with the corresponding term frequencies in the document.

628,217,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This approach, however, is known to produce non-optimal results because a few doc- uments with multitudinous occurrences of a rare term can skew the results. A more common method is to count the number of documents that contain a given term at least once. This metric is known as the document frequency of a term. The inverse of the document frequency can then be used as a measure of term rarity. The standard formula for the inverse document frequency (IDF) for term t is as follows: idfptq “ 1 ` ln N dfptq ` 1 (4.22) in which N is the total number of documents in the collection, and dfptq is the document frequency of the term.",632,117,158.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
629,217,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Similarly to term frequency, a logarithm function is used to smooth down the magnitude of the coefﬁcient for rare terms.

Sub- stituting expression 4.23 into the deﬁnitions of the dot product and Euclidean norm, we get the following formulas that can be used to cal- culate the cosine similarity score for query q and document d under the TFˆIDF model: q ¨ d “ ÿ t in q tfpt, dq ¨ idfptq ˆ tfpt, qq ¨ idfptq (4.24) ∥q∥ “ d ÿ t in q rtfpt, qq ¨ idfptqs2 (4.25)",772,145,193.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Let us consider one particular example that makes the following three adjustments, which are known to work well in practice: 1. The document norm deﬁned by equation 4.26 normalizes all doc- ument vectors to a unit length.

One possible relaxation is to match not the entire phrase but shingles, that is, sequences of several terms. Such sequences are also called n-grams and can include two terms (bigrams), three terms (trigrams), or more. Shingles can be viewed as a tokenization technique that is applied to both document and query, and the resulting n-grams are fed into a Boolean query or TFˆIDF scorer.",627,106,156.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This ability to capture semantic relationships is especially important to differeniate between compound terms such as tuxedo coat and sports coat.

Item property values can be short strings such as product names, long text snippets such as descriptions or reviews, numbers, tokens from a discrete set such brand names, or even nested or hierarchical entities such as product variants or categories. This cre- ates a diversity of features and signals that are measured on different scales and may not be directly comparable.

For example, the query black levi strauss jeans clearly requests products of type jeans, color black, and brand levi strauss. On the other hand, each item is also represented as a set of properties, so we can expect to get a good result by creating documents with multiple ﬁelds where each ﬁeld corresponds to an item property, running the query against each ﬁeld in isolation to get multiple signals, and then blending the signals into the ﬁnal score.

The same relevance problem sometimes can be solved in different ways, either by tuning the mixing function or by constructing a better more accurate signal.

The search result structure in Figure 4.10 is quite basic, and we can program more complex behavior by relaxing the signal mixing func- tion. One possible solution is to mix weaker signals with the strongest one in a controllable way.

The problem of fragmented features and signals arises because the standard multiﬁeld search we discussed above scores each ﬁeld independently. Although it may not be obvious at ﬁrst glance, it can be the case that individual ﬁelds correlate reasonably well with a query to produce a strong av- erage signal but the overall coverage of query conditions by all ﬁelds remains low. Let us consider the following basic example with two product documents [Turnbull and Berryman, 2016]: Product 1 Name: Polo Brand: Polo Product 2 Name: Polo Brand: Lacoste It is quite intuitive that the second product is more relevant for the query Lacoste Polo, but TFˆIDF calculations give a different result. Re- call that the practical TFˆIDF scoring formula 4.29 for one-term ﬁelds boils down to the following equation: query coordination factor query norm ˆ ﬁeld norm ˆ tfpterm, ﬁeldq ˆ idf2 ﬁeldptermq (4.35) The query coordination factor is 0.50 for all four ﬁelds because only one of the query terms matches (Polo or Lacoste).",1210,195,302.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
661,228,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The query norm, ﬁeld norm, and TF value are also the same for all terms and ﬁelds. The IDF values for Polo and Lacoste are the same for the brand ﬁeld, but different from the Polo IDF in the name ﬁeld. Consequently, the name and brand ﬁelds (pairwise) have the same scores in both documents and the total document scores are equal as well; it does not matter which function we use to mix the query signals, sum or maximum. The fundamental reason is that each ﬁeld matches exactly one query term (either Polo or Lacoste) to produce equally strong signals, but the fact that the second document as a whole covers two terms and the ﬁrst document covers only one term is not taken into account.

The downside of this method is that the resulting signal can be too blurry, in the sense that secondary features become as important as the primary ones. For example, a dress can have the phrase wear with any shoes in the description, which can make the dress pop up in the search results for shoes if the product-type feature is not differentiated properly. The second alternative for the fragmented feature problem is based on the observation that single-term queries are not vulnerable to the fragmentation described above.",618,101,154.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
664,229,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Moreover, each term in a query can be considered as a separate criterion added by the user to narrow down the search result, so it can be reasonable to score a document for each query term independently, producing a signal that indicates how well this particular criterion is satisﬁed, and then blend all the signals to produce the ﬁnal score. This approach is called term-centric scoring to differentiate it from the ﬁeld-centric approach that we used earlier. The term-centric signal pipeline can be thought of as multiple ﬁeld-centric pipelines executed for every query term to produce signals that are ﬁnally mixed into the ﬁnal output, as shown in Figure 4.13. The sig- nals from different pipelines are summed up because the more terms that match, the better (the average signal strategy); meanwhile, the strongest signal strategy can be applied to signals from the different ﬁelds within a term pipeline.

A programmatic system can provide an interface that facilitates the speciﬁcation of desired search results and design of the signal mixing pipelines, as well as experimental evalua- tion.

Newness, for example, can be measured as the number of days since a product was introduced at the store, and the average customer rating can be a real number on a scale from 1 to 5. The base score can be calculated by using one of the signal engineering methods that we discussed earlier.",614,107,153.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Each upper tier is created by amplifying the corre- sponding signal so that all products that exhibit a property required for this signal are elevated above the lower tiers in the search results list. The ﬁrst tier that we put on top of the base score is the exact brand match. We have to amplify the brand signal by assigning it a boosting,632,115,158.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We clearly need to rescale the raw rating and newness values to convert them into meaningful scoring factors; this can be done in many dif- ferent ways. A raw customer rating on a scale from 1 to 5 can be too aggressive as an ampliﬁcation factor and can be tempered by using a square root or logarithm function to reduce the gap between low-rated and high-rated products. For instance, the magnitude of the brand sig- nal ampliﬁed by a raw rating of 5.0 is two times higher than for a rating of 2.5; however, by taking the square root of the rating, we reduce the difference down to 1.41.

Although we have used a few techniques, such as stem- ming, that deal with speciﬁc features of natural language, we have es- sentially reduced the search problem to a mechanical comparison of to- kens. This approach, sometimes referred to as a syntactic search, works very well in practice and is used as a core method in most search en- gine implementations. Syntactic search, however, has limited ability for modeling the features of natural language that go beyond individual terms. The meaning of words in natural language is often dependent on the context created by the preceding and succeeding words and sen- tences, and several types of such dependencies exist.",786,130,196.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
675,233,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Most of them are related to one of the following two categories: polysemy Polysemy is the association of one word with multiple meanings. For instance, the word wood can refer to the material or an area of land ﬁlled with trees. Polysemy represents a seri- ous problem for relevance because a user might have in mind one meaning of a word (e. g., products made of wood) but the search engine will return documents that use the same word with a different meaning (e. g., products that are related to woodlands, such as forestry equipment). We have already encountered the problem of complex concepts that are expressed with phrases that must be treated as a single token, for example, dress shoes. This issue can be viewed as a particular case of polysemy be- cause the meaning of the individual words depends on the con- text, so the meaning of the word dress depends on whether it is followed by the word shoes.",912,162,228.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
676,233,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:A particular case of polysemy that is very common in merchandising applications is the usage of vo- cabulary words in brand and product names. An example of this problem would be the brand name Blue, which is indistinguish- able from the color blue in queries like blue jeans.synonymy Words are considered as synonyms if they can express nearly the same meaning in a given context, such as candy and sweet. Synonymy is also a major problem for search relevance because a basic syntactic search is not able to match relevant doc- uments that do not contain the given query term but do contain synonyms. For example, items that contain the term sweet are likely to be relevant for the query candy, but all of the search methods we have discussed so far would fail to handle this de- pendency.",790,139,197.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In a similar way, stemming can be viewed as a technique that handles synonymy in a very basic form by reducing closely related terms to the same root. These methods, however, lack the insight into the words’ mean- ings and relationships that is required to solve polysemy and syn- onymy problems. These issues require us to develop new techniques that are focused on contexts and meaning, rather than separate tokens. This approach is known as semantic search, named after the branch of linguistics that studies the meaning and relationships of words and phrases.",772,128,193.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
678,234,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Some methods of semantic searching are completely indepen- dent from syntactic searching and compete with it, but many semantics techniques can be used to extend syntactic search. Polysemy and synonymy can be viewed as a problem of hidden re- lationships between words or, alternatively, as a problem of ﬁnding logical concepts that are materialized in words. From the latter stand- point, polysemy refers to the case of two distinct concepts mapped to one word, whereas synonymy refers to the opposite case of two dis- tinct words mapped to one logical concept. The problem of semantic analysis and search can therefore be viewed as the problem of ﬁnding the right concepts and mappings between words and concepts. This way of thinking is often referred to as concept search [Giunchiglia et al.,",796,130,199.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This term emphasizes the fact that concepts are not merely statistical relationships between words but logical entities that can be deﬁned by using domain knowledge and other considera- tions. We will spend the rest of this section discussing the methods of se- mantic search and analysis that can help with polysemy and synonymy problems; some of these methods are closely related to recommenda- tions. We will also use examples from the grocery domain, instead of apparel, for a change.4.5.1 Synonyms and Hierarchies The most basic solution to the synonymy problem is a manually cu- rated thesaurus, that is, a catalog of words and their synonyms.",670,108,167.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
680,234,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Once created, a thesaurus can be used to transform documents and queries in a way that closely resembles stemming. For example, we can deﬁne the following set of words as synonyms: candy, sweet, confection",205,34,51.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
681,235,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:220 search Our goal is to make these terms identical from the querying stand- point, so that documents containing the terms sweet and confection are retrieved for the query candy, and the other way around. This can be done in a few ways, and each method has advantages and disadvan- tages. The ﬁrst approach is contraction. One of the synonyms in the list is assigned to be the principal, and all occurrences of other synonyms are replaced by the principal. For example, we can choose to replace all occurrences of sweet and confection with candy, both in documents and queries.",578,100,144.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
682,235,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Note that a principal does not necessarily have to be a real word; it can be a special token that never appears in the input texts but is used as an internal representation of a synonym group. Thus, the contraction approach works exactly like stemming. Contraction clearly achieves the goal of making all synonyms identical from the query- ing standpoint, but the downside is that it collapses all synonyms into the principal, which makes frequently used synonym terms indistin- guishable from rarely used ones. This can negatively impact TFˆIDF calculations. The alternative to contraction is expansion.",604,96,151.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
683,235,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The expansion strategy replaces each synonym instance with a full list of synonyms: best candy shop Ñ [best] [candy] [sweet] [confection] [shop] Expansion can be applied to either documents or queries, but not both. Document-side expansion may have the same negative impact on TFˆIDF scoring as contraction and also increases the size of doc- uments. Query-side expansion preserves the correct IDF statistics but makes a query more complex from the computational standpoint. The expansion technique has one very important application that goes far beyond basic synonym processing. Although synonyms are deﬁned as words that have roughly the same meaning, it is often the case that one word represents a broader logical concept than another.",740,114,185.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
684,235,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The relationship between such synonyms becomes asymmetric in the sense that a broader concept can be considered as a synonym for a narrower one, but not the other way around. For example, cake can be used as a synonym for cheesecake, but it would be incorrect to replace cake with cheesecake in some contexts. Consequently, it can be beneﬁcial to elaborate the expansion process and replace plain synonym lists with directed rules, such that occurrences of cheesecake are expanded into cake and cheesecake but occurrences of cake are not expanded. This type of expansion is called genre expansion. Developing this idea further, we can construct a hierarchy of terms that describes nested classes of concepts, as illustrated in Figure 4.16.",739,120,184.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

For instance, an item that contains the term fruitcake will be included in a search results list for queries with the terms cake and bakery. Figure 4.16: Example of a category hierarchy for grocery products. Similarly to basic expansion, genre expansion can be applied to both documents and queries, but the methodology is quite different because of the asymmetry of expansion rules. By applying genre expansion to documents, we make queries for broad concepts match documents about speciﬁc concepts, but not vice versa.",561,89,140.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
687,236,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:For example, a query for cake will return cheesecakes and fruitcakes. By applying expansion to queries, we make queries for speciﬁc concepts match documents about broad concepts, so a query for cheesecake returns cakes. In applying genre expansion to documents, we also artiﬁcially decrease the IDF of broad concepts because these terms are copied to more documents. This is not necessarily negative because speciﬁc concepts will be scored higher than broad ones, which is typically reasonable from a relevance standpoint. Contraction and expansion are very powerful techniques for mod- eling semantic networks, and they give us some clues on how known semantic relationships can be utilized in query processing.",712,109,178.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

One possible solution is to create lists of synonyms manually.

On the other hand, it can be a challenge to manually curate a thesaurus in search applica- tions with dynamic content, such as marketplaces.

Our next goal will be to develop methods that are able to learn a thesaurus automatically.4.5.2 Word Embedding The vector space model states that a document or query can be rep- resented as a vector in a linear space of terms. In the light of our dis- cussion of the polysemy and synonymy problems, we know that terms can be ambiguous and redundant, so it can be the case that a document representation that uses terms as dimensions is not particularly good or is at least ﬂawed.",652,118,163.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
690,237,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Indeed, we have already discussed that polysemy and synonymy can be viewed as a mismatch between words and con- cepts, which suggests that words are a convoluted representation that conceals semantic relationships. We can attempt to ﬁnd a better representation by changing the ba- sis for the document space. Conceptually, we would like to map doc- uments and queries to vectors of real numbers, so that the ranking scores can be calculated simply as a dot product between the query and document representations: q Ñ p d Ñ v scorepq, dq “ p ¨ v “ k ÿ i“1 pivi (4.40) in which p and v are the k-element vector representations of a query and a document and k is the dimensionality of the vector represen- tation. Note that individual words can also be mapped to such vector representations because each word can be treated as a single-word doc- ument. This approach is generally known as word embedding.",901,158,225.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
691,237,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The term embedding is used because the number of dimensions k is typically small relative to the number of distinct words, so a high-dimensional vector space model representation where each word has its own dimen- sion is embedded into a low-dimensionality space. Word embedding has many applications, which depend on how the vector representations are constructed and used. From the search services perspective, we are mainly interested in two possibilities. First, embedded representations can be used for actual query processing, so that document scores for a given query are calculated as dot products between the representa- tions. Second, embedded representations of individual words can be",696,105,174.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The key problem of word embedding is, of course, how to construct the new vector representations. Conceptually, we want a vector space that preserves semantic relationships: words and documents with sim- ilar or related semantic meanings should be collocated or lie on the same line, whereas documents that have different semantic meanings should not be collocated or collinear, even if they contain the same (pol- ysemic) words. If we could construct such a space, it would be possible to overcome the limitations of the vector space model. First, it would be possible to ﬁnd relevant documents for a query even if a document and query did not have common terms, that is, to tackle the synonymy problem.",826,138,206.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
693,238,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Second, it would be possible to rule out semantically non- relevent documents even if they nominally contained query terms. In- tuitively, we can assume that the semantic space can be constructed by analyzing word co-occurrences, either globally in a document or locally in a sentence, and identifying groups of related words. The dimensions of the semantic space can then be deﬁned based on these groups, and, consequently, the vector representations of individual documents and words will be deﬁned in terms of afﬁnities to the groups. It turns out that this simple idea is very challenging to implement, and there exist a large number of methods that use very different mathematical tech- niques. We continue this section with a detailed discussion of several important approaches and concrete models.",804,127,201.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Word embedding is a relatively new term, and many semantic analysis methods, including the latent semantic analysis and probabilistic topic modeling described later in this section, were not developed speciﬁcally for word embedding (in the sense of equation 4.40), but for different purposes and based on different considerations. Most of these methods are very generic and powerful statistical methods used in a wide range of applications from natural language processing to evolutionary biology. These methods, however, can also be viewed as word embedding techniques.

The intuitive expectation is that terms that frequently appear together can be synonyms that correspond to one logical concept. Thus, analysis of co-occurrences can reveal concepts that are not explicitly observed in the documents as terms but that exist at a semantic level. These concepts are referred to as latent concepts.

This matrix, known as a term–document matrix, is a representation of the documents in the term space. We can calculate the similarity between documents by calculating a dot prod- uct between the corresponding columns, and the similarity between terms can also be calculated by taking a dot product between the cor- responding rows. The term similarity calculated this way already pro- vides some hints about semantic relationships between terms, in the sense that terms that frequently appear together can be related to the same concept. This metric, however, can be too noisy, so we need to use a more robust statistical method.",1012,186,253.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This essentially means that the original vector space model vectors (the rows of matrix X) will be decorrelated by collapsing the strongly correlated vectors into a single principal vector. This follows our intuitive expectation – the frequently co-occurring terms correspond to highly correlated compo- nents of the original term vectors (the rows of matrix X), so the decor- relation is likely to merge co-occurring terms (potentially synonyms) into one concept vector.",1063,173,265.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In other words, pLSA, similarly to LSA, can be viewed as a matrix factorization algorithm, but this factorization is driven by a different objective. Whereas LSA is driven by minimization of the approxima- tion error, pLSA is driven by maximization of the likelihood function or, alternatively, minimization of the divergence between the observed distribution and the model.4.5.5.3 pLSA Properties The pLSA model offers several important advantages over LSA. First, the directions in the pLSA space are non-negative and interpretable as probabilities.",787,132,196.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
735,252,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The directions in the LSA space do not have formal interpretation and the values produced by the LSA factorization can be negative, which also complicates the interpretation. The second important difference is the handling of the polysemy prob- lem. LSA is able to map synonyms to the same location in the latent semantic space, but it is typically not able to distinguish different mean- ings of the same word depending on the context. By contrast, pLSA distributes the probability mass of a term over several different topics that can correspond to the different senses of a word [Hofmann, 1999]. More speciﬁcally, if the same term t is observed in two different docu- ments di and dj, the topic it has the strongest association with in the context of the ﬁrst document argmax z Pr pz | di, tq can be different from the topic that this term is associated with in the context of the second document argmax z Pr ` z | dj, t ˘ Despite these advantages, pLSA generally involves more complex implementation than LSA.",1013,177,253.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

These probabilities are the pa- rameters that need to be estimated from the data.

These issues can be addressed by creating a model with a more elabo- rate generative process than the pLSA process that we described earlier. In this section, we discuss one of the most prominent examples of such models, called the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

The predictive model can be built in such a way that each word is associated with a vector of weights set by the model ﬁtting process. These vectors can then be interpreted as word representations in some latent semantic space, sim- ilarly to the vectors produced by LSA or topic models, so this vector representation can be used for search and thesaurus creation.

769,263,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:One of the main reasons is that search results produced by standard scoring and signal mixing methods tend to be excessively diverse, which creates a poor user experience. For example, the query red dress can match a wide range of products that contain these two terms in their attributes, including dresses, shoes, and even watches. The advanced signal engineering and mixing techniques that we discussed earlier can help to improve the results, but they are unlikely to provide a robust solution for the problem. Another reason is that TFˆIDF scoring and other popular scoring meth- ods can perform poorly on highly structured documents with multitudinous categorical ﬁelds.

Moreover, many brand names contain common words, which makes proper interpretation even more challenging. For example, the query pink sweater can match all products made by the brand Pink Rose, and, conversely, the query pink rose sweater can match all products of pink and rose colors although it clearly indiates an intent to ﬁnd a certain brand. The observations above suggest that we should develop search meth- ods that are focused on precision, exact matching, and attribute struc- tures, as opposed to scoring. In other words, we should consider search methods that treat documents more like database records that have to be queried, rather than free texts that have to be scored.",881,142,220.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We will spend the rest of this section discussing these methods.4.6.1 Combinatorial Phrase Search Our ﬁrst goal is to improve the precision of search results, given that documents have many categorical ﬁelds that often contain compound and polysemic terms. We can make the observation that making users write structured Boolean queries would be a great solution for this problem. For example, the free-text query pink rose sweater becomes much less ambiguous if the user explicitly articulates ﬁelds and com- pound terms: brand:[pink rose] AND type:[sweater] This approach can be used in certain applications of merchandising search if the user is provided with a convenient interface that helps to specify individual ﬁelds.",897,139,224.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This can be a reasonable solution for business domains with a relatively cohesive as- sortment, such as automobiles or real estate, but free-text queries are arguably preferable for domains with diverse merchandise, such as de- partment stores. A free-text query does not contain document ﬁelds or demarcation of compound terms, which thereby creates ambiguity. The idea of a com- binatorial phrase search is to recover some of this information by gen- erating multiple Boolean queries with different combinations of ﬁelds",691,107,172.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A query generation algorithm is designed to produce relatively restrictive search criteria, so that doc- uments must strongly correlate with a query to match. This increases the probability that documents are included in a search results list not because of accidental matching of separate terms but because the doc- ument attributes provide a really good coverage of query terms and phrases. This methodology can be considered as a generalization of shingling for multiﬁeld documents.

A combi- natorial phrase search query assembled for such ﬁelds and partitions will have the structure presented in Figure 4.26. The query can become very large and computationally challenging as the number of ﬁelds and query terms increases, but we can partially mitigate this by intro- ducing certain simpliﬁcations. For example, we can limit the maximum length of sub-phrases in a partition because sub-phrases that are too long are unlikely to represent meaningful compound terms.",950,155,237.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Moreover, a combi- natorial phrase search becomes even more restrictive as the length of the query grows because all terms need to be covered. This behavior is different from the standard vector space model that appreciates every term match and, thereby, decreases in precision as the length of the query increases. The disadvantage of combinatorial phrase search is that the number of partitions grows exponentially with the number of terms in the user query and so does the number of statements in the resulting Boolean query.

The combinatorial phrase search can be considered as a technique for ﬁnding documents that provide complete query coverage in terms of sub-phrases and ﬁelds. This method, however, can be connected to semantic search as well. Although the combinatorial search does not detect semantic relationships as explicitly as LSA or Word2Vec do, it attempts to identify and match compound terms that are likely to rep- resent logical concepts. In other words, it can be viewed as an attempt to build a semantic search with syntactic search primitives [Giunchiglia et al.,",665,105,166.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The combinatorial approach, however, has its own downsides. One of the most signiﬁcant issues is that strict matching can return an empty search results list if a query contains misspelled words or some other unfortunate combination of terms that cannot be covered by the available documents. This behavior is unde- sirable because it leaves the user with an empty screen instead of a list of products, which thereby decreases the probability of a conversion.",576,93,144.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Although it is very important to present the user with a set of relevant prod- ucts that meet the search intent, it is also important to demonstrate the available assortment in the best possible way, given that the user can browse only a limited amount of search results. Efﬁcient utilization of the display space is a major challenge for merchandising search be- cause product catalogs often contain closely related products that are likely to be perceived by the user as duplicates. For example, it can be more reasonable to present the user with a set of relevant but different dresses, rather than multiple variants of the same dress that comes in several colors and sizes. The problem of duplicated products and inefﬁcient usage of the dis- play space arises from the hierarchical relationships between items in the product catalog.",1043,171,260.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

An example of a product variant would be Levi’s 511 jeans in a white color and size of 30W ˆ 32L. All physical instances of the same variant are considered identical. •A product is a logical entity that includes one or several product variants.

The major problem with this approach is that it loses the structural information about nested entities, which makes it impossible to distinguish valid attribute combinations from invalid ones. The document above is scored well for the query small red suitcase, and this is correct because one of the vari- ants really is small and red. However, the same document is scored equally well for the query small black suitcase.

796,272,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This prob- lem is quite challenging from the implementation standpoint because it cannot be solved purely in terms of plain documents and requires a search engine either to explicitly support nested entities or to operate with variant-level documents internally and then rework the results to group variants into products. If product ﬁltering is implemented correctly, product-level results can substantially improve the merchan- dising efﬁciency of a search service. We have found that collapsing product variants into products can be beneﬁcial, so we can consider the possibility of collapsing products into product collections as the next step. This question is more complicated because a user can have different search intents and look for either products or product collections.

This problem can be approached by introducing heuristic merchandising rules to analyze the structure of the results and matching attributes and make a grouping decision. For instance, we can choose to replace individual products by a collection only if a collection is generally consistent with the query, that is, all or almost all products in the collection and the collection-level attributes match the query.

The optimization objective is to maximize the overall economic performance of a search service, so we should optimize the relevance metrics for a set of queries with the largest con- tribution to the total service proﬁts. In other words, we can informally express the overall economic performance of a search service as the sum of contributions from individual search queries: Revenue “ ÿ qPQ Rpqq ¨ mpqq (4.94) in which q is a query, Q is a set of possible queries, Rpqq is the av- erage revenue of conversions attributed to query q, and mpqq is the quality metric of the search results, which is assumed to be propor- tional to the conversion rate.",974,168,243.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The goal is then to learn a ranking model that predicts the grade y from the input that consists of a query and a document. Similarly to other supervised learning problems, learning to rank starts with feature engineering. As we have already mentioned, the relevance grade is predicted for a document in the context of a certain query, so a feature vector depends on both the document and the query. More speciﬁcally, the following groups of features are typically used in practice [Chapelle and Chang, 2011; Liu and Qin, 2010]: document features This type of features contains the statistics and attributes for the document, including the following: • The basic document statistics, such as the number of terms.",922,152,230.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

These functions typically fall into one of three categories: pointwise The pointwise approach attempts to predict relevance grades for each document independently and thereby reduces ranking to a standard regression or classiﬁcation problem. Consequently, the overall loss function L0 is deﬁned as a sum of the prediction errors for individual grades: L0 “ ÿ q,d L ` f ` xq,d ˘ , yq,d ˘ (4.96) in which f ` xq,d ˘ is a predicted relevance grade and Lp¨q is a classiﬁca- tion or regression loss.

However, the pointwise approach has a major downside, regardless of the choice of the loss function. The issue is that we are concerned with the relative order of items in the search results list, not in qualitative or quantitative estimates of individual grades. For example, the point- wise approach does not recognize that we will perfectly rank a results list of four items with relevance grades (1,2,3,4), even if the grades are predicted as (2,3,4,5).",782,140,195.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

One possible way to leverage this information is to incorporate it into feature vectors, as we already did in the previous section. We could take a step further and attempt to develop a method that learns the relevance grades from implicit feedback. Although it is intuitively clear that users tend to click on relevant search results and skip irrelevant ones, user behavior can communi- cate more sophisticated relevance relationships.

This problem is not trivial because a user can make multiple queries with only one search intent but formulate it differently or can make multiple unrelated queries in a search for completely different products.

A grocery store can carry only a certain number of products that is limited by the available shelf space, a radio station can squeeze only a certain number of songs into its daily schedule, and a theater can put on only a limited number of performances. A seller can increase capacity and expand the assortment, but the additional revenues cap- tured by this expansion start to diminish after a certain point because of the limited total demand. The marginal costs associated with the expansion, however, may not diminish as rapidly as the revenues or may not diminish at all, so the marginal costs eventually overrun the marginal revenue, which makes further assortment expansion uneco- nomical.

Ratings are typically represented as a matrix where each row cor- responds to a user and each column corresponds to an item.",725,115,181.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
863,292,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Let us denote the rating matrix as R “ ` rij ˘ , so that rij is a rating given by user i for item j. In a recommender system that tracks m users and contains a catalog of n items, R is an m ˆ n matrix. In practice, the rating matrix is almost always incomplete – ratings are known only for a subset of user–item pairs and the remaining elements are miss- ing (unspeciﬁed). The known ratings are usually numerical values that can be deﬁned differently depending on the business domain, market- ing channel, and source of data. We will distinguish the following two cases: ordinal The interface of a recommender system often allows the user to express their preferences by choosing ratings from a dis- crete set of numbers (e. g., 1, 2, or 3 stars) or a continuous range (e. g., from -5 to +5). It is also typical to capture ratings as cat- egorical variables with two (e. g., like or dislike) or more (e. g., bad, good, or excellent) categories and then map them to discrete numerical values.",991,184,247.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
864,293,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:278 recommendations than preferences. For example, an implicit rating can indicate how frequently a user purchases a certain item or how much time a customer spent on a product details page on the website.unary In many cases, a rating matrix does not capture the level of afﬁnity between a user and item but merely registers the fact of an interaction. For example, many interfaces have only one Like button, so a user can either like an item or provide no feedback at all. Another typical example of unary ratings is implicit feedback that registers interactions between users and items but does not capture details, such as the number of purchases, although it can be argued that the simple quantitative properties of this feedback are important [Hu et al.,",759,128,189.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
865,293,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:2008]. The elements of an unary rating matrix can take only two values – either one or unspeciﬁed. The rating values in matrix R are often attributed with contextual information, such as the date and time that the rating was set, the marketing channel used by the customer to provide the rating, and so on. This information can be used by a recommender system to ﬁgure out which rating values are most relevant for a given context. An important observation about rating values is that a matrix with explicit ordinal ratings also contains implicit feedback.",556,95,139.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
866,293,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The reason is that users typically tend to rate the items they like and avoid the items they ﬁnd unattractive. For example, a user can totally avoid music of cer- tain genres or products from certain categories. Consequently, which items are rated is important, in addition to how they are rated. In other words, the distribution of ratings for random items is likely to be dif- ferent from the distribution of ratings for items selected by a user. This means that a recommender system, strictly speaking, should not rely on the assumption that the distribution of observed ratings is represen- tative of the distribution of missing ones [Devooght et al.,",655,110,163.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
867,293,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:2015]. As we will see later, some advanced recommendation methods take this con- sideration into account and infer the implicit feedback from the rating matrix. In a more general case, a recommender algorithm can involve two separate rating matrices for both explicit and implicit feedback. The second important property of a rating matrix is sparsity. A rat- ing matrix is inherently sparse because any single user interacts with only a tiny fraction of the available items, so that each row of the ma- trix contains only a few known ratings and all other values are miss- ing.",578,97,144.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
868,293,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Moreover, the distribution of known ratings typically exhibits the long-tail property that we have discussed earlier. This means that a disproportionally large number of the known ratings correspond to a few of the most popular items, whereas niche product ratings are es- pecially scarce. This property can be illustrated by a well-known data",343,53,85.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The long-tail property is a challenge for the design and evaluation of recommender systems because both recommenda- tion algorithms and recommendation quality metrics tend to have a bias toward popular items, which reduces the quality of recommenda- tions for niche products.5.2 business objectives The key business objectives of recommendation services are closely related to the objectives of merchandising search.

This requires an extension of the basic objective of providing relevant results because the notion of relevance becomes increasingly shaky as the search intent loses its sharpness. Consequently, the standard set of objectives for a recommender system is often deﬁned as follows: relevance The recommendations suggested to a user should be rel- evant, in the sense that a user has a high propensity to purchase the recommended items and rate them highly.novelty A recommender system does not fulﬁll an explicit search re- quest but rather advises users on available options.

For exam- ple, a user who buys books about machine learning might be pro- vided with recommendations to buy more books on this topic – although some of the recommended items might be novel to the user, we probably cannot consider them as serendipitous.

The recommendations produced in accordance with these objectives can be re-ranked in the pursuit of additional merchandising goals, such as the promotion of high-margin or seasonal products, with the aim of improving the margin part of the equation.5.3 quality evaluation Our next step is to design quantitative metrics that can be used to eval- uate the quality of recommender systems with regard to the objectives deﬁned in the previous section.

Based on the evaluation results, the model can be re-built with different parameters by using the training data and evaluated again. The testing data set is used to ﬁnally assess the quality of the model at the very end of the process. » ——————–",581,99,145.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

By interpreting the recommendation problem as a rating prediction problem, we can deﬁne several quality metrics that can be linked to the business objectives. We will spend the next sections developing these metrics.5.3.1 Prediction Accuracy The accuracy of rating predictions can be considered a measure of rel- evance because it quantiﬁes how well a recommender system can pre- dict the user utility as estimated by the users themselves. To measure the accuracy, we can choose from a wide range of metrics used in ma- chine learning and information retrieval, including the search quality metrics that we discussed earlier.",878,141,219.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
880,297,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:The ﬁrst family of metrics we will consider are prediction accuracy metrics that are widely used for the evaluation of classiﬁcation and regression methods. Let us denote the set of observed ratings ruj P R as R and the test subset used for accuracy evaluation as T Ă R. For each rating in T, a recommendation algorithm produces an estimate pruj, so the prediction error can be deﬁned as follows: euj “ pruj ´ ruj (5.4) The overall quality of the rating predictions can then be obtained by averaging the pointwise prediction errors. There are several ways to deﬁne this average metric. The ﬁrst option is the mean squared error (MSE) deﬁned as MSE “ 1 |T| ÿ pu,jq P T e2 uj (5.5) The MSE metric is not always convenient because it operates with squared error values, which cannot be directly compared to the orig- inal rating values. We can ﬁx this by deﬁning the root mean squared",881,159,220.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

However, the RMSE and similar pointwise accuracy metrics have several important drawbacks: • As we discussed earlier, ratings typically follow a long-tail distri- bution, which means that ratings are dense for the popular items and sparse for those items from the long tail. This makes rating prediction more challenging for the long-tail items relative to the popular items and results in different prediction accuracies for these two item groups. The RMSE does not differentiate between these two groups and simply takes the average, so poor accuracy for the long-tail items can be counterbalanced by high accuracy for the popular items.",1018,168,254.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
882,298,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:To measure and control this trade-off, we can calculate the RMSE separately for different item groups or add item-speciﬁc weights into equation 5.5 to account for item margins or other considerations. •The goal of a recommender system is to predict how a user will rate an item in the future based on the historical data. User tastes and interests may change over time, so the system should be able to recognize such temporal trends to make accurate predictions about future behavior. The RMSE does not directly account for this aspect of recommendations. The problem, however, can be addressed with the proper design of a test set T.

The RMSE does not account for ranking and equally penalizes predic- tion errors for items at both the top and bottom of the list. It can be argued that algorithms with a very small difference in RMSE can have a big difference in their lists of the top K items [Koren, 2007].",673,114,168.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

First, we should note that the concepts of precision and recall are directly applicable to the top K recommendations problem. If Iu is the subset of items in test set T that is positively rated (e. g., purchased) by user u and YupKq is the list of top K items recommended to that user, we can deﬁne the precision and recall metrics as functions of K: precisionpKq “ |YupKq X Iu| |YupKq| (5.8) recallpKq “ |YupKq X Iu| |Iu| (5.9) For any given K, the quality of a recommender algorithm can be measured in terms of these two metrics – precision is the percentage of relevant recommendations in the list, and recall is the percentage of items consumed from the set of available relevant items. Two recom- mender algorithms can be compared in terms of precision and recall averaged by users, just like search methods can be compared in terms of these metrics. The number of recommendations in the list, how- ever, is a critical parameter that inﬂuences the precision–recall trade- off achieved by an algorithm.",1174,204,293.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Fortunately, we have already introduced a range of ranking quality metrics that can be adapted to provide just such a summary view. For example, we can adapt the discounted cumulative gain (DCG) for recommendations by using known ratings as relevance grades. Recall that we deﬁned the DCG for a list of K items as follows: DCG “ K ÿ i“1 2gi ´ 1 log2 pi ` 1q (5.10) in which gi is the relevance grade of the i-th item in the list. If test set T contains ratings provided by m users, we can deﬁne the overall DCG as the average of the DCGs for the recommendation lists for individual users: DCG “ 1 m m ÿ u“1 ÿ i P Iu Rui ď K 2rui ´ 1 log2 pRui ` 1q (5.11) in which Iu is the subset of items in test set T positively rated by user u, Rui is the rank of item i in the list of recommendations for user u, and rui is the rating from set T provided by user u for item i, which is used as an approximation of the relevance grade gi from equation 5.10.",1130,224,282.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This information is not directly available in the rating matrix, so it should either be gathered through real-life testing and user surveys or somehow inferred from the rating matrix. Since real-life testing and surveys are generally time and resource consuming, we can attempt to design a novelty metric based on the rating matrix, which requires certain assumptions to be made.",818,131,204.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We can leverage the similarity metrics developed earlier for search services to measure the diversity. For example, we can calculate cosine distances between item descriptions for all pairs of items in the list of recommendations and estimate the diversity as the reciprocal of the average distance.5.3.6 Coverage The goal of a recommender system is to predict the missing ratings in the rating matrix.",695,107,173.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This makes it important to measure the coverage provided by a recommender system, that is, the percentage of users or items over which the system can make recommendations. In certain cases, this percentage can be estimated based on the require- ments imposed by a recommendation algorithm.

This is the reason why this group of methods is referred to as content ﬁltering. The main idea of content ﬁltering is quite straightforward: take items that the user positively rated in the past and recommend other items similar to these examples, as shown in Figure 5.6. The important constraint, how- ever, is that the measure of similarity is based on the item content 1 and does not include behavioral data, such as information about items that are frequently purchased or rated together by other users. This effec- tively means that a content-based recommender system uses only one row of the rating matrix – the proﬁle of the user for whom the recom- mendations are prepared.",933,155,233.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
907,306,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:This limited usage of the rating information is typically counterbalanced by a similarity function that uses a wide range of carefully engineered item features. The recommendations are then ranked according to their similarity scores and, optionally, the rating values of corresponding items in the proﬁle. For example, as- suming that item 1 has the highest rating in the example shown in Figure 5.6, that is, ru1 ą ru2 and ru1 ą ru3, a candidate item similar to item 1 can be ranked higher than candidate items equally similar to items 2 or 3.

A more generic and ﬂexi- ble interpretation of the content ﬁltering problem is to consider it as a machine learning task in which each item should be rated by us- ing a regression or classiﬁcation model trained on the user proﬁle. In other words, for each user, we create a dedicated proﬁle model that can predict whether the user will like a given item or not. The model is trained by using items from the proﬁle: each item rated by the user is converted into a feature vector by a content analyzer and the corre- sponding rating is used as a training label. Each candidate item is then also converted into a feature vector and evaluated by using the proﬁle model, as illustrated in Figure 5.7.",830,148,207.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Other families of recommendation methods can produce results that are much more difﬁcult to explain or interpret. On the other hand, content ﬁltering has a number of disadvantages that are often the ﬂip sides of its advantages: • Feature engineering.",589,90,147.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The user rating for item i can then be pre- dicted as the average rating of nearest neighbors: prui “ 1 k k ÿ t“1 ru ´ dui t ¯ (5.15) in which ru pdq is the rating of an item that corresponds to docu- ment d. This estimate can be further reﬁned by weighting the ratings according to the similarity score: prui “ 1 k k ÿ t“1 ru ´ dui t ¯ ¨ sim ´ di, dui j ¯ (5.16) The similarity measure is typically calculated by using the tech- niques that we developed for search services. One popular approach is to use the basic vector space model: the textual ﬁelds of the item documents are preprocessed by using stemming and stop words, each document ﬁeld is represented as a vector of terms, the distance between the corresponding ﬁelds is calculated according to the TFˆIDF model, and then the scores for different ﬁelds are combined into the ﬁnal similarity score by using some signal mixing function. This is exactly the same as document scoring in search services; the only difference is that the TFˆIDF similarity score is calculated for a pair of documents, rather than a document and query. The second popular option is to use the latent topic model instead of the basic vector space model: each document ﬁeld is represented as a vector in the space of latent topics by using latent semantic anal- ysis (LSA) or latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the distance between the corresponding ﬁelds is calculated as a cosine distance between the corresponding vectors in the latent topics space, and the scores for dif- ferent ﬁelds are combined together into the ﬁnal score.",1689,299,422.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
921,310,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Once again, this approach is almost identical to the LSA and LDA search methods that we discussed earlier. LDA-based scoring is sometimes considered to be superior to LSA and basic TFˆIDF models [Falk, 2017]. It has been successfully used in some major industrial systems, such as The New York Times’s article recommendation engine [Spangher, 2015]. On the other hand, some reports show that LSA can outperform LDA in cer- tain applications, such as movie recommender systems [Bergamaschi et al.,2014].",502,79,125.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

In con- trast to the nearest neighbor regression, this method does not rely on heuristic similarity metrics but uses the Naive Bayes classiﬁer, a stan- dard algorithm for text classiﬁcation, as a proﬁle model to predict the ratings. First, let us assume that each item in the catalog has multiple textual attributes. For example, a book may have attributes such as title, au- thors, synopsis, published reviews, customer comments, related titles, and related authors. We choose to apply tokenization, stemming, and stop words to the attributes and then model each attribute as a bag of words, that is, a vector in which each element corresponds to a word and the value is the number of word occurrences in the attribute text.",898,146,224.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
923,311,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Consequently, each item is represented as a document with multiple ﬁelds, and each ﬁeld is a bag-of-words model of the corresponding attribute. Next, we need to create a proﬁle model. Recall that the ultimate goal of a content-based recommender is to rank catalog items for each user in order of preference. We can approach this problem by building a binary classiﬁer that estimates two probabilities: the probability that an item would be rated positively by a user and the probability that it would be rated negatively. The ratio between these two probabilities indicates whether an item would be rated positively rather than nega- tively, and, consequently, we can use it as a ranking score for the rec- ommended items.",722,119,180.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
924,311,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Let us assume that a user rates items on a discrete scale from 1 to rmax, and all ratings below rmax{2 are interpreted as negative, whereas ratings above rmax{2 are interpreted as positive. For example, with a rating scale from 1 to 10 stars, ratings of 1–5 are considered negative (dislike) and ratings of 6–10 are positive (like). Recall that the main idea of the Naive Bayes text classiﬁer is to es- timate the probability of a document d being in a certain class c by using conditional probabilities of document words w occurring in a document of class c, under the assumption that these conditional prob- abilities are independent. This approach can be expressed by using the following formula: Pr ` cj | d ˘ “ Pr ` cj ˘ Pr pdq ź wiPd Pr ` wi | cj ˘ (5.17) in which cj is the document class, which in our case is either nega- tive c0 or positive c1, Pr ` cj ˘ is the empirical probability of class cj in the training data (the fraction of documents that belong to the class),",980,185,245.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This ba- sic Bayes rule needs to be extended to accommodate the multiple ﬁelds that we have in each item document. By assuming that each item doc- ument has F ﬁelds and each ﬁeld fqm is a text snippet that contains ˇˇfqm ˇˇ words, we can rewrite formula 5.17 for the posterior class proba- bility as follows: Pr ` cj, d ˘ “ Pr ` cj ˘ Pr pdq F ź m“1 ź wi P fm Pr ` wi | cj, fm ˘ (5.18) The ranking score of the item can then be estimated as scorepdq “ Pr pc1 | dq Pr pc0 | dq (5.19) and items in the recommendation list can be sorted accordingly, from the highest to lowest scores.

The Naive Bayes model, however, interprets the word healthcare as a nega- tive signal, so all books with this word in the title will be scored lower. This limited ability to differentiate between the quality and relevance of content is one of the major shortcomings of content-based ﬁltering.

Although this approach does not necessarily pro- duce bad recommendations, it is ﬂawed in at least two ways. First, customer choice is heavily inﬂuenced and driven by personality, atti- tudes, and lifestyle.

Second, certain types of recommen- dations, such as cross-category recommendations, are fundamentally difﬁcult to do if nothing but basic features are available. One of the reasons is that the layout of product attributes can be different in differ- ent categories, so it can even be difﬁcult to deﬁne the similarity metric",649,103,162.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The fundamental shortcoming of this approach is that human tastes cannot be easily expressed in terms of basic product attributes, so man- ual product tagging and advanced feature engineering is often needed to achieve good results. On the other hand, the rating matrix captures a lot of information about user tastes and judgements. Indeed, each known rating can be interpreted as a manually set product attribute, and, consequently, the collection of ratings and other feedback data from users can be viewed as a crowdsourcing approach to product tagging with psychographic features.

The meaning of collaborative ﬁltering has also transformed and become more focused on making rating predictions based on information available in the rating matrix.

946,319,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Consequently, collaborative ﬁlter- ing methods are essentially matrix completion algorithms that use the rating matrix as the only input. Under the hood, collaborative ﬁlter- ing uses a predictive model to capture interactions between users and items known from the rating matrix and to predict a rating for a given pair of user and item based on how similar users rated similar items in the past. The key advantage of collaborative methods is that they are capa- ble of making recommendations based only on the patterns and sim- ilarities available in the rating matrix, without any additional infor- mation about catalog items. This makes these methods much more universal than content-based ﬁltering, which requires domain-speciﬁc knowledge, data, and feature engineering effort. Even more impor- tantly, collaborative ﬁltering implicitly accounts for the psychographic proﬁles of users and items because the ratings capture human tastes and judgements.",956,144,239.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Although this is generally true, col- laborative ﬁltering methods may need to make certain domain- speciﬁc assumptions. For example, a collaborative recommender system may or may not assume that customer tastes change over time and, consequently, may or may not account for rating re- cency.

Model-based methods go beyond the nearest neighbor approach and use other, usually more sophisticated, predictive models. Although the nearest neighbor algorithm can also be considered as a sort of predictive model and, hence, the boundary between the two categories is a bit blurry, it makes sense to separate them because of the high practical importance of neighborhood-based methods.

953,321,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:306 recommendations A typical rating matrix exhibits strong user and item biases – some users systematically give higher (or lower) ratings than other users, and some items systematically receive higher ratings than other items [Koren, 2009; Ekstrand et al.,2011]. This can be explained by the fact that some users can be more or less critical than others, and items, of course, differ in their quality. We can account for these systematic user and item effects by deﬁning the baseline estimate for an unknown user rating rui as bui “ µ ` bu ` bi (5.32) in which µ is the overall average rating in the rating matrix R, bu is the observed deviation of user u from the average, and bi is the observed deviation of item i from the average. In practice, the user and item biases have strong effects, and, consequently, the baseline estimate deﬁned by equation 5.32 has substantial predictive power.",894,154,223.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
954,321,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Although this model captures only the average user and item effects, it can help to absorb the biases and isolate the signal that represents user–item interactions that can be captured by more specialized models. The biases µ, bu, and bi can be estimated one after the other as the average residual errors of the previous estimate. This means that we ﬁrst compute µ, and then estimate item biases bi as follows: bi “ 1 | Ui | ÿ i P Ui prui ´ µq (5.33) in which Ui is the set of users who rated item i. Then, the user biases are estimated as bu “ 1 | Iu | ÿ u P Iu prui ´ µ ´ biq (5.34) in which Iu are items rated by user u. The estimates calculated with formulas 5.33 and 5.34 can be unstable in the case of a sparse rating matrix where only a few known ratings are available for a user or item. The stability of the estimates can be improved by adding regularization parameters λ1 and λ2 as follows: bi “ 1 | Ui | ` λ1 ÿ i P Ui prui ´ µq bu “ 1 | Iu | ` λ2 ÿ u P Iu prui ´ µ ´ biq (5.35) The regularization parameters decrease the magnitudes of biases bi and bu when the user or item has few ratings, so the baseline estimate",1127,234,281.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

If we assume that the user has already rated some items in the catalog, so that the corresponding row of the rating matrix contains some known values, we can try to ﬁnd more users who rated the same items and did it with a similar sentiment, in the sense that these users mainly like the items positively rated by the given user and dislike the negatively rated ones.",1063,176,265.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

As our goal is to predict the rating for user u and item i by averaging the ratings given for this item by other users, we select not simply the top k most similar users but the top k most similar users who have rated item i. Let us denote this set of peers as Sk ui. This set can include less than k users if the rating matrix does not contain enough ratings for item i or enough peers of user u with commonly rated items.

One of the key advantages is that the total number of items m in the system is often small enough to precalculate and store the m ˆ m item similarity matrix, so the top k recommendations can be quickly looked up for a given user proﬁle. This enables a more scalable architecture for the recommender system: the heavy computations re- quired to create the similarity matrix are done in the background, and the recommendation service uses this matrix to make recommenda- tions in real time. Although the same strategy can be applied to user- based methods, it can be very expensive or completely impractical in recommender systems with a high number of users.",1166,201,291.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

At the same time, it should be noted that user-based approaches are able to capture certain relationships that might not be recognized by item-based methods [Koren and Bell, 2011].

This prediction is unlikely to be accurate if none of the items rated by the user is similar to i. On the other hand, it may still be the case that the user-based approach will identify users similar to u who rated i, so the rating can be reliably predicted. As we will see later, some advanced recommendation methods combine item-based and user-based models to take advantage of both methods. The ratio between the number of users and items is one of the key considerations in the choice of approach. In many retail applications, the item-based approach is preferable because the number of items is smaller than the number of users. The number of items, however, can exceed the number of users in some other domains.",761,133,190.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

To make the statement about weighted averages more explicit, let us note that the user-based and item-based rating prediction functions 5.41 and 5.56 essentially have the following forms: prui “ ÿ v P Sk ui wuv ¨ rvi (user-based) (5.58) prui “ ÿ j P Qk ui wij ¨ ruj (item-based) (5.59) in which wuv and wij are the weights proportional to the user-based and item-based similarities, respectively.

In the case of centered input rat- ings, the output rating prui is also centered, so the global average, item average, or baseline prediction needs to be added back in at the end. In order to solve a regression problem for the rating interpolation weights, let us ﬁrst consider a hypothetical case in which the rating matrix is so dense that all users except u have rated both item i and all its neighbors Qk ui, as shown in Figure 5.10.items users Qui R wij i j u rvi Figure 5.10: Item-based nearest neighbor regression.

Consequently, the estimates of the corresponding elements of A and b can be more or less reliable, depending on the number of known ratings. We can account for this by using the discounted similarity technique that we discussed earlier and shrinking the estimates by the corresponding support: Ajh “ 1 ˇˇ Ujh ˇˇ ÿ v P Ujh rvjrvh bj “ 1 ˇˇ Uij ˇˇ ÿ v P Uij rvjrvi (5.67) in which Uij is the set of users who rated both item i and item j.

One possible way to compute the optimal weights is to solve equation 5.66 numerically by inverting matrix A, but this is not the only possible option.

To explore this idea, let us go back to square one and reﬂect a little bit on the nature of recommender services.

In practice, these dimensions are often interpretable as genres, styles, or other attributes that are applicable to both users and items.

At each step, we ﬁrst move in the negative gra- dient direction and then adjust the solution to stay within the feasible set: min x f pxq subject to x P C learning rule: zpt`1q “ xptq ´ α ¨ ∇f ´ xptq¯ xpt`1q “ argmin x P C  zpt`1q ´ x  (5.108)",1007,183,251.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This means that we can map the solution updated by gradient descent to the feasible set by subtracting its projections onto the previ- ously computed concepts. For instance, with the assumption that the ﬁrst user concept vector p1 (the ﬁrst column of matrix P) is determined during the ﬁrst iteration of the outer loop of algorithm 5.1, a candidate solution for the second concept vector p2 (the second column of matrix P) can be orthogonalized as p2 “ p2 ´ proj pp2, p1q (5.109) in which proj pa, bq is the vector projection of a onto b deﬁned as proj pa, bq “ a ¨ b b ¨ bb (5.110) At the next step, the third user concept vector can be orthogonalized by subtracting its projections onto the previous two p3 “ p3 ´ proj pp3, p1q ´ proj pp3, p2q (5.111) and so on. This process is essentially an iterative version of the Gram–Schmidt process, a basic procedure in linear algebra that takes an arbitrary set of linearly independent vectors and constructs a set of orthogonal vectors from it. The same approach can be used for the item concept vectors, that is, for the columns of matrix Q. Inserting these orthogonalization operations into algorithm 5.1, we get algorithm 5.2, which uses exactly the same inner loop to update the elements of the latent factors but has an additional projection step to orthogonalize the basis of the concept vectors.",1544,268,386.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1038,356,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Finally, we conclude this section with a remark about the different types of constraints that can be imposed on the latent factors, other than orthogonality. Algorithm 5.2 produces strictly orthogonal latent factors, even in the case of an incomplete rating matrix. This improves the interpretability of the results to a certain extent, but the relation- ships between users, items, and concepts can still be difﬁcult to inter- pret because of the interplay of positive and negative factor values.

For example, the implicit feedback matrix can be created based on purchase or web browsing histories, so that each non-zero element indicates an interac- tion between a user and item. The idea of the factorized model with implicit feedback is to intro- duce an additional set of item factors where each factor value yid characterizes how much the act of rating item i increases or decreases the proximity to concept d.

Basic collaborative ﬁltering, for example, is focused on the rating matrix analysis and neglects item content; meanwhile, content-based ﬁltering does the opposite.

We use ensemble theory in the following sections to build hybrid recommenders, by starting from very basic methods and gradually increasing the complexity.5.9.1 Switching One of the most basic ways to combine several recommendation algo- rithms together is simply to switch between them depending on some condition. For example, we can assume that a collaborative ﬁltering method works well enough unless an item has too few known ratings, in which case content-based ﬁltering is likely to do a better job [Burke,",791,119,197.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1050,362,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:5.9 hybrid methods 347 2002]. Consequently, we can switch between these two algorithms de- pending on the number of users who rated an item: prui “ $ ’ ’ & ’ ’ % pr (collaborative) ui , if | Ui | ą 20 pr (content) ui , otherwise (5.121) in which Ui is the set of users who rated item i. This solution can help us to work around the cold-start problem, which is an issue for collaborative ﬁltering, and, at the same time, to improve trivial rec- ommendations produced by content-based ﬁltering whenever possible. A generic schema of such a switching recommender is shown in Fig- ure 5.16. This approach, however, is somewhat rudimentary because it is based on heuristic rules rather than a formal optimization frame- work. We can deﬁnitely achieve better results by leveraging machine learning and optimization algorithms to properly mix the outputs of the individual models.",874,151,218.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This can be done by using heuristic rules, as we did in the switching approach described in the previous section, but, at the same time, it is naturally a regression problem that can be efﬁciently solved by using the machine learning toolkit.

These statistics are impor- tant for a hybrid recommender because the reliability of the estimates produced by the constituent models depends on the number of avail- able ratings and other similar factors reﬂected in the statistical signals.

The feature augmentation technique refers to a design where several recommendation models are chained together in such a way that predictions produced by one recommendation model are consumed by another model as inputs. We already used this approach in blending with residual training, but this idea can be exploited in several other ways. One possible approach for chaining two recommenders together is to use the ﬁrst model in the chain to generate completely new features that are not present in the raw data, so that the downstream models can use them as inputs. For example, the content-based Naive Bayes recommender described in section 5.5.2 can leverage item attributes such as related authors and related titles to recommend books.",887,139,221.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1072,369,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:These attributes can be created by using an item similarity measure computed over the rating matrix, that is, by using collaborative ﬁltering [Mooney and Roy, 1999]. This effectively creates a hybrid recommender with feature augmentation, where collaborative ﬁltering is the ﬁrst model in the chain that generates new features and the content-based classiﬁer is the second model that consumes them. The second option for chaining recommenders is to use the ﬁrst rec- ommender in the chain to enhance the features that are present in the raw data. For example, a content-based recommender can be used to ﬁll missing elements in the rating matrix, and this enhanced matrix can then be used by some collaborative ﬁltering method. This approach can be contrasted with the previous example, which uses collaborative ﬁl- tering to augment the inputs of the content-based Naive Bayes recom- mender.",891,141,222.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

1074,370,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:5.9 hybrid methods 355 challenge, however, is that the ratings ﬁlled in during the previous step skew the statistics of the number of known ratings used by many col- laborative ﬁltering algorithms. This requires the collaborative ﬁltering part to be modiﬁed and several additional factors and parameters to be introduced to ﬁx the statistics: • The reliability of content-based rating predictions depends on the number of known ratings for a given user. Consequently, predic- tions that do not have enough support should be devalued when used in collaborative ﬁltering. If we use a user-based neighbor- hood model for the collaborative ﬁltering step, we can account for the reliability of the incoming ratings by modifying the user similarity measure. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne a normalized support vari- able that grows proportionally to the number of ratings provided by a user but is limited to one if the number of ratings exceeds the threshold parameter T: qu “ $ & % 1, | Iu | ě T | Iu | {T, otherwise (5.132) The similarity function can then be redeﬁned by adding a factor that equals the harmonic mean of the support variables for two users: sim1pu, vq “ 2quqv qu ` qv ¨ simpu, vq (5.133) The harmonic mean is chosen because it is biased toward the minimum of two numbers, so the similarity measure will be sig- niﬁcantly penalized if either user has provided too few ratings. •",1378,238,344.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

First, it is worth noting that recommendations produced by different models should not necessarily be blended together – a recommender system can simply display sev- eral lists of recommended items. Ecommerce web sites, for example, very often display several recommendation bars with different seman- tic meanings, such as Customers who viewed this item also viewed, Inspired by your browsing history, Top rated items, Similar items, and so on.",899,134,224.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1078,371,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:These pieces of content can naturally be created by using different recommen- dation algorithms, including both personalized and non-personalized methods. Recommender systems that use this approach are typically referenced as mixed hybrids. In certain cases, the recommended items need to meet additional requirements or conditions, depending on how the recommendations are presented and how the user interacts with the recommendation service. For example, a user can explicitly request the recommendation of restaurants in a certain location or more books similar to the selected one. In such cases, the recommender system can be used as a sorting component that postprocesses the results created by a search service or another recommendation model.",750,110,187.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This technique, sometimes referred to as cascading, can be viewed as an extreme case of blending, where the signal from the ﬁrst recommender or search service is steeply pitched to sort items into relevant and irrelevent buckets and the second recommender does the secondary sorting within the buckets.5.10 contextual recommendations The majority of recommendation algorithms, including all of the meth- ods we have discussed earlier in this chapter, are based on the assump- tion that the relevance of a given item for a given user can be pre- dicted by using only the proﬁles of the item and user. This approach completely ignores the circumstances under which recommendations are made, including time, user location, marketing channel, and other pieces of information about the situation and environment.

We can have more than one hierarchy for one dimension. For instance, dates can also be categorized into weekdays and weekends, so that rating matrices for weekdays and weekends can be obtained.

One of the key considerations for the preﬁltering approach is the trade-off between data sparsity and contextualization accuracy. On the one hand, contextualization of the input data can improve the accuracy of recommendations because the recommendation algorithm uses only the ratings that are relevant for the context. On the other hand, contextualization decreases the amount of data available for the recommendation algorithm, which can neg- atively impact the quality of recommendations. For example, a movie recommendation service that makes weekend recommen- dations by using only the ratings submitted on the weekends al- most certainly loses some relevant signals carried by the weekday ratings.",940,150,235.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A good example of such variability is item popularity changes over time that can be caused by external factors, such as fashion changes that make certain garments more or less popular, the appearance of an actor in a new movie that boosts the popularity of related movies, or advances in technology that make old electronic devices outdated. Another example is the drift of user preferences over time that can be caused by changes in tastes, social role, or location. For instance, a user who used to rate an average item as 4 stars can become more critical or advanced over time and then give only 3 stars to mediocre products. At the same time, temporal context information is also one of the easiest types to collect because time stamps can be set internally by a recommender system without external dependencies on marketing channels or user interfaces.",1066,174,266.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Recall that the stan- dard baseline estimate of a rating is deﬁned as follows (section 5.6.1): bui “ µ ` bu ` bi (5.144)",370,63,92.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Parameter t can be deﬁned as the number of days measured off from some date zero in the past. In practice, user and item components can have very different temporal dynamics and properties, so one might need two different solutions for these two functions [Koren, 2009]. In many practical applications, item popular- ity changes slowly over time and each item has relatively many ratings.",731,127,182.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1102,380,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Therefore, the time range can be split into multiple time intervals (for example, several weeks each), and the item bias can be estimated for each interval independently. This leads to the following simple time- aware model for the item component: biptq “ bi ` bi,∆t (5.146) in which bi is the global stationary bias, ∆t is the time interval into which t falls, and bi,∆t is the item bias estimate for this time bucket. Note that the time-dependent part of the bias can be estimated only for historical dates and has to be set to zero if the entire ∆t period is in the future. It may seem strange that this model does not attempt to extrapolate the time trend into the future, but it is important to keep in mind that baseline estimates are used as a component in more advanced models and their goal is to remove the observed trends and reﬁne the signal; extrapolation can be done by the remaining parts of the model. Although this approach can work well for items, it may not be ef- ﬁcient for users for at least two reasons.",1026,188,256.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1103,380,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:First, one user generally has far fewer ratings than one item, so the bias cannot be reliably esti- mated even for relatively large time intervals. Second, user biases can change much faster than item popularity, and this requires the use of even smaller time buckets. This problem can be solved by modeling the user bias drift as a simple function, instead of point estimates. For instance, one can use the following functional form to model the drift: duptq “ sgnpt ´ tuq | t ´ tu |β (5.147) in which sgnpxq is a sign function that equals one when x is positive and equals ´1 when x is negative, tu is the mean rating date, and β is the constant parameter selected by using cross-validation.

It can be argued that ratings can lose their relevancy over time, so the fact that a user equally liked two items in the past should not necessarily contribute to the similarity of these items in the future because of the transient nature of user taste and identity [Ding and Li, 2005; Koren, 2009].

As a result of the wide variability of user intents, recommender systems beneﬁt greatly from accessing and utilizing personal and behavioral data; systems that do not access and use this data are likely to deliver poor quality recommendations.

Let us ﬁrst consider the case with a single secondary objective and deﬁne a relatively abstract framework that can be adapted for a wide range of objectives. First, we can use the core recommendation algo- rithm to rank all m items for each of n users.

These methods provide relatively coarse price optimization methods that can, however, inform strategic pricing decisions.

Consequently, real-life price management processes often in- clude multiple layers of decision making, which range from strategic executive decisions down to micro-decisions at the level of individual transactions. We are distilling this complexity into the relatively simple model presented in Figure 6.1. This model does not explicitly account for some strategic aspects of pricing, but it captures the major features of the pricing environment that are important for micro-decisioning: • We generally assume that a company sells some products to its customers and earns the following proﬁt G for each product i: Gi “ Qi pPi ´ Viq ´ Ci (6.1) in which Qi is quantity sold, Pi is price, Vi is variable costs (e. g., wholesale product price), Ci is ﬁxed costs associated with the product, and i iterates over the assortment of products offered to the customers.

1157,399,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:For example, a company can choose a competitor-oriented strategy that pursues market share, rather than proﬁts, and restrict the optimization process with a price-match policy. •The proﬁt is a function of the quantity sold which, in turn, de- pends on the demand. The key assumption made by the model is the heterogeneity of the demand, that is, the variability of the demand according to one or many dimensions, such as customer segments, store locations, seasons, classes of service, and so forth. This provides an opportunity to differentiate prices according to these dimensions as well and, thus, tune proﬁts at the level of individual customer segments or time intervals.

Consequently, the revenue management system has a number of inputs, including historical demand data, ﬁxed and variable costs, stock levels, and other business constraints. •Although optimization of the price level is a natural task for a revenue management system, many environments provide other important controls.

A steep slope means that customers are sensitive to price changes and demand rapidly drops as the price rises, whereas a shallow slope means that customers are relatively insensitive to price changes. It is more common, however, to measure price sensitivity not as a slope of the demand function but as the elasticity of demand, deﬁned as the ratio of the percent change in demand to the percent change in price: ϵ “ ´∆q{q ∆p{p “ ´ p qppq ˆ B Bpqppq (6.9) Although the elasticity in equation 6.9 is a function of price, meaning that it can be different at different points of the demand curve, this term is often used more loosely by assuming that the elasticity is roughly constant in the range of interest, so the demand can be characterized by a single value of ϵ. The elasticity of demand does not depend on mag- nitudes of price or volume, so it provides a convenient way to measure and compare price sensitivities. Elastic markets, with ϵ ą 1, respond to a small change in price with a large change in demand.

We will assume linear demand curves for the optimization of basic price struc- tures because of their analytical convenience, although this is typically a very gross approximation of real demand functions. One of the short- comings of the linear demand model is that it assumes that every dollar of price change yields the same increment in demand.

More speciﬁcally, we can expect that demand for a product is persistently low if its price is set much higher than competitive prices and minor changes in the price have very little stimulus, that is, the local demand elasticity is low. In the same vein, prices that are set much below the market are likely to drive persistently high demand that will be rela- tively insensitive to small price changes – customers will perceive the deal as a bargain anyway. The highest price sensitivity is likely to be in a zone around the competitive prices, where small changes in price can signiﬁcantly impact the demand. These considerations, as well as empirical support, suggest a sigmoid shape for the demand curve, as depicted in Figure 6.6.",995,166,248.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Broadly speaking, this requires the setting of fences between customers with different willingness to pay in such a way that cus- tomers with higher willingness will not be able to a pay the lower price intended for the lower segments. The fencing mechanisms are multi- tudinous and vary across industries, although most variations can be reduced to a few basic principles. Let us consider a few examples of price-fencing techniques from the retail industry that demonstrate the remarkable ingenuity in this regard: store zone Stores in a retail chain are typically located in different neighborhoods with different demographic and competitive fac- tors, such as average household income, average family size, dis- tance to the nearest competitive store, etc. This naturally sepa- rates customers by levels of price sensitivity and ability or will- ingness to look for an alternative supplier.",1038,162,259.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This list of price fences can be extended with more techniques from other industries, such as airline fare classes or credit card deals. The optimization strategy for price segments can be demonstrated with the setting of prices for n segments in a way that maximizes proﬁts. We can start with the following equation that straightforwardly follows from Figure 6.8: G “ n ÿ i“1 pqi ´ qi´1q ppi ´ Vq (6.30) in which pi and qi are the prices and quantity sold for a segment i, respectively, and q0 “ 0.",878,148,219.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Although this approach might not be feasible for cameras because of implementation and competition reasons, variations of this are successfully applied in other industries. The two structurally similar price strategies that exploit this idea are two-part tariffs and tying arrangements: two-part tariffs A two-part tariff is a price structure with two components – an entrance fee and a metered price.

This enables a man- ufacturer to create tying arrangements that prevent a customer from switching between brands and to rebalance the prices of the related products. Examples of tying arrangements can often be found when a durable product (the tying product) is com- plemented with a consumable part (the tied product), such as a razor handle and razor blades or a printer and ink cartridges. The revenue contributed by the consumable parts can dominate the total consumer lifetime value, so the durable product can be priced lower or even below its marginal costs.",895,147,223.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1219,422,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Let us now consider quantitative models that provide directions on how the entrance price pe and metered price pm of a two-part tariff can be optimized. We have previously mentioned that the demand curve can be interpreted both as an aggregate demand of the market deter- mined by the maximum willingness to pay and as the consumption level of a single customer at a given price. Two-part tariffs explicitly depend on the level of consumption and, consequently, require us to account for both the level of consumption and the demand heterogene- ity, so we have to use a more complicated model than the one we used for unit pricing and price segmentation [Smith, 2012; Oi, 1971]. Let us ﬁrst consider the case of a single consumer, for whom the demand curve is shown in Figure 6.10. Recall that the equation of the linear demand curve is q “ Qmax ´ 1 ´ pm P ¯ (6.36) The consumer evaluates the product or service at price P, so the surplus gained by buying a unit at metered price pm is numerically equal to the area of the triangle under the demand curve bounded by the pm line.",1078,196,269.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf
1220,422,"adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf:Consequently, we can assume that the optimal entrance fee is equal to this surplus because a lower fee will leave available proﬁts on the table and a higher fee will drive the consumer out of the market.

This strategy, for example, is widely adopted by amusement parks that tend to charge high entrance fees rather than charge per ride. The approach with the high entrance fee, however, faces a strong headwind in the case of competition or heterogeneous demand where customers are willing to purchase different quantities of a product at a given price. This situation is depicted in Figure 6.11, where multiple demand curves have the same slope but differ in quantity purchased.",1226,222,306.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

This can reverse the price balance of the original two-part tariff – the metered element can become dominant in the total proﬁt relative to the entrance element. This shift can also be driven by competition, which limits the seller’s ability to extract consumer surpluses though the entrance fee.6.5.4 Bundling Bundling is often deﬁned in economic texts as the sale of two or more separate products in one package at a single price.",724,118,181.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

From the price optimization standpoint, we are most interested in price bundling that offers two or more products at a discounted price relative to the sum of the individual product prices; this discount is the only advantage to the alternative of buying unbundled items. Price bundling is a popular price structure that can be found in many industries. Examples of price bundles include sport and opera season tickets, restaurant meals that bundle an appetizer, entree, and dessert, luggage sets with several bags of different size, kitchenware, and soft- ware suites. A seller typically has a choice between three options: to sell unbundled products, to sell a group of products only as a bundle, which is known as pure bundling, and to offer the individual products as well as the discounted bundle, which is called mixed bundling.",1075,180,268.75,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

A model may or may not include controls for con- sumer choice, demand changes over time, competitive prices, and so on.",1012,161,253.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It places a strong emphasis on consumer de- cisions to enable a ﬁne-grained analysis of the factors that inﬂuence consumer choice. A supermarket chain carries a large number of products that are divided into merchandising categories, such as cheese, wine, cookies, and milk. Each category is further divided into subcategories such that products within a subcategory are similar and are often good substi- tutes for one another but the difference between subcategories is sub- stantial. For example, a ﬂuid milk category can include subcategories such as whole milk, fat-free milk, ﬂavored milk, and so on.",840,130,210.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

At the same time, this demand model was designed for assortment analysis and optimization, so it explic- itly accounts for consumer choice, which makes it well suited to the assortment-related problem that we will consider in later sections. The demand for a single product can be broken down into three separate decisions that apply for every consumer visiting a store: • First, a consumer purchases or does not purchase from a subcat- egory. Let us denote the probability that a consumer purchases any product from a subcategory during the visit to the store as Prppurchase | visitq. •Second, a consumer chooses which product to buy within a subcategory.",845,139,211.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Let us denote it as E rQ | j, purchases.

The purchase incidence is a binary choice variable (purchase/no pur- chase), so we can use a standard modeling approach – express the pur- chase probability as a sigmoid function that approximates the binary decision and estimate its exponential parameter from the data.

Estimation of the probability of the purchase of a given product in a subcategory is a little bit more tricky. As we have seen earlier, con- sumer choice can be modeled by using the multinomial logit model (MNL), so we express the probability of the purchase of a product among alternatives as follows: Prpj | purchaseq “ exppyjq ř i exppyiq (6.56) in which i iterates over all products in a subcategory and yj is a pa- rameter variable.

Competing products and their attributes play an important role in demand modeling even if the assortment is not the main concern. For example, the online fashion retailer Rue La La reported that the relative price of competing styles and the number of competing styles are in the top three most important features in their demand prediction model [Ferreira et al.,2016].",638,101,159.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

The model is geared towards sales events optimization and places strong emphasis on the temporal dimension of the demand. Seasonal clearance sales are an integral part of the business strategy for many apparel retailers. A regular selling season, which is typically biannual (fall–winter and spring–summer), is followed by a relatively short clearance sale period that aims to sell off the remaining inventory and free up space for the new collection for the next season. Some retailers exercise even smaller sales cycles to overrun competitors and get more revenues from customers by offering more diverse and ﬂuid assortment.",872,137,218.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We describe the demand model in two steps, in accordaance with the original report [Caro and Gallien, 2012]. The ﬁrst step is to pre- pare the available demand data for regression analysis by removing seasonal variations and accounting for demand censoring due to stock- outs. Next, the regression model itself is speciﬁed.6.6.2.1 Demand Data Preparation Most clothing items come in multiple colors and sizes, so every stock keeping unit (SKU) can be referenced by using a product number r and size–color variant v. With the assumption that the historical sales and inventory data are available on a store level for individual days, let us denote sales of SKU pr, vq at store h on day d as Spr, v, d, hq and the cor- responding inventory level at the beginning of the day as Lpr, v, d, hq.",1002,169,250.5,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

First, let us introduce a seasonality factor that incorporates intra- week and inter-week demand variations.

In the approach described above, the key task is demand uncon- straining. One possible approach is to use historical data for products that did not sell out to estimate the demand for products that did sell out.

Most events that start, for example, in the morning may have similar demand curves and thus belong to the same cluster. The clustering rule can be more complex and involve multiple properties.

The shifting effect is especially important in cases of constrained sup- ply because it can help to achieve a more even demand distribution and reduce stockouts. For example, the supply of seats in an opera house is ﬁxed but the demand can vary signiﬁcantly, typically reaching its maximum on the weekends and its minimum on weekdays.

Another challenge of demand shift- ing models is that cross-segment dependencies make the optimization problem inseparable and sharply increase its computational complex- ity. Assuming that we draw prices from a discrete set of size m and the number of segments is n, we might need to evaluate as many as mn price combinations if the demand model does not follow any particular functional form that exhibits properties such as linearity or convexity.

This view on price optimization assumes perfect replenishment, such that a seller is always able to deliver the quantity of a product demanded at the proﬁt-optimal price. This as- sumption is reasonably fair for some industries, such as supermarket retail, where it is possible to build a supply chain that almost perfectly replenishes the inventory and stockouts are rare. However, as we have already discussed, it does not hold in many other industries that face different supply constraints.

As usual, we denote the price, de- mand, and variable costs as p, qppq, and V, respectively. Variable x corresponds to the actual quantity sold. This problem is quite trivial because the demand is a monotonically decreasing function of price.

In addition, dynamic pricing typically deals with strict capacity and time constraints that introduce additional complexity, which, in turn, makes automated optimization appealing. Although it is intuitive that dynamic pricing can be beneﬁcial by providing an additional degree of freedom in comparison with static prices, we need to explore this concept more deeply to understand why one would beneﬁt from changing prices over time.

It can, however, try different markdowns to ﬁnd a price that maximizes proﬁts and matches the inventory constraints. From the optimization standpoint, dynamic pricing does not neces- sarily require specialized optimization methods.

In many business domains, especially in retail, customers constantly make a choice between competing or sub- stitutable products by using the price of one product as a reference point for another product, so the demand for a given product is usually a function of both the product price and the prices of the competing products. If this is the case, the prices cannot be optimized for each product in isolation, and the prices for all competing products need to be optimized jointly instead.",1629,301,407.25,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

We also assume that the retailer has a demand prediction model that estimates the demand for a given product as a function of the product price and the prices of competing products. In the case of an unlimited inventory, the model can predict the true (unconstrained) demand.

Consider a service provider that has 20 units of a resource and sells them at a full price of $300 and a discounted price of $200. The demand for the full price service is estimated to be normally dis- tributed with a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 2.

Given that we reserve y units to be sold at full price, the marginal revenue for a full-price unit can be deﬁned as r1pyq “ $300 ˆ PrpQ1 ě yq (6.106) In other words, the marginal revenue is the difference between the expected revenue from the full price segment, given that y units are allocated for this segment, and the corresponding revenue, given that only y ´ 1 units are allocated.",1272,235,318.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Examples of such complementary products include coffee and sugar, cosmetics and handbags, and even beer and diapers. One possible way to leverage these opportunities is to identify products that customers tend to buy together and optimize the store layout or placement of content items on a media site to sim- plify navigation and encourage customers to buy product sets instead of single products. The ﬁrst part of this strategy, the identiﬁcation of items that are fre- quently bought together, can be accomplished by using a basic market basket analysis.

Consequently, a lift higher than one indicates afﬁnity of the items (assuming statisti- cal signiﬁcance of the results, of course).

This problem is very typical in the retail industry because a retailer can change product assortment within a category relatively easily and the primary goal is to utilize the available resources, such as shelf space, in the most efﬁcient way. A category represents a relatively cohesive set of products that have a lot in common such as “dairy desserts” or “women’s jeans”, so it is generally possible that customers might be willing to substitute one product with another if the product of their choice is not available for some reason. The reasons for product unavailability can include both deliberate assortment changes and temporary stockouts. One of the main goals of category management is to ﬁnd a subset of products that meets physical constraints, such as available shelf space, and max- imizes the proﬁt by taking advantage of the substitution effect in the optimal way.",1112,179,278.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

Equation 6.128 requires the estimation of the substitution probabili- ties αkÑj and original demand rates dj. In order to do this estimation, let us assume that the following variables are known (we already dis- cussed demand prediction in Section 6.6): • Qjh, j P Nh: the demand for product j per customer at store h.

Substitution rates αkÑj are challenging to estimate because up to J2 different rates can exist for the assortment of J products. It is unlikely that a retailer has enough data to estimate this variety of rates reli- ably. However, there is empirical evidence that the following simplistic model of customer behavior is sufﬁciently accurate in practice and re- quires the estimation of just one variable instead of J2: if product k is not available, customers either select their second-choice product j as a substitution with the probability δ, which is the same for all products in a category, or no purchase takes place, with the probability p1 ´ δq. This model leads to the following simple equation for the substitution rate: αkÑj “ δ 1 |N| (6.129) In order to estimate δ, let us deﬁne the total demand at a given store as the sum of Qjh values, which can be estimated from the data: Sh “ ÿ jPNh Qjh (6.130)",1020,178,255.0,adtech/algorithmic-marketing-ai-for-marketing-operations-r1.8ga.pdf

It is important to note that the model enables a retailer to perform what-if analyses to evaluate how changes in as- sortment and stock levels might impact the gross margin.

In most marketing applications, we deal with probability distribu- tions of random variables, such as events or counts.

The online advertising ecosystem consists of companies, technology  systems, and complex technical processes all working together to serve ads to online users across the  Internet. Online advertising has brought with it a number of positives. For one, it’s provided content creators with a  source of revenue so they can distribute their content for free to online users.",535,92,133.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1512,8,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, while the online advertising industry has experienced a number of ups, there have also been many  downs. Some key examples include being hit hard by the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s/early 2000s, and  more recently, the introduction of privacy laws (e.g. the GDPR) and privacy settings in browsers (e.g. Safari’s  Intelligent Track Prevention) that have negatively impacted advertisers, AdTech companies, and publishers. Why Have We Written This Book? Throughout our 12+ years of designing and building advertising and marketing technology, we’ve noticed 2  things:  1. The platforms and processes that make up AdTech are highly complex.",649,103,162.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1513,8,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:2.

1523,13,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:02. Advertising basics  The Advertiser-Publisher Relationship  Digital advertising is a global multibillion-dollar industry comprising thousands of companies, but at the heart of  it all are two key players: the advertiser and the publisher . The advertiser-publisher relationship dates back well before the invention of the internet. Publishers, such as  newspapers and magazines, would sell ad space to advertisers as a way to generate additional revenue on top  of their regular subscriptions and individual sales. 13",520,80,130.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1524,14,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Nowadays anyone can become a publisher by simply creating a website or developing a mobile app and  selling ad space to advertisers. This has completely changed the dynamics of the traditional  advertiser-publisher relationship. What is an Advertiser? An advertiser is a brand or company (e.g. advertising agency) that wants to get its product or service in front  of its target audience to build brand awareness, develop brand loyalty, and increase sales. Below are some examples of brands that spend billions of dollars ($USD) per year on advertising:  Advertisers aren’t only big brands, however; millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and  organizations advertise their services and products online every day.",729,115,182.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1525,14,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Large brands, such as those listed above, are often represented by advertising agencies , whose job it is to:  Create the campaign : Designing the graphical elements and message of the ad. Execute the campaign : Configuring the campaign (e.g. setting up targeting and frequency capping) and  launching it across different channels (e.g. web, in-app, and DOOH). Manage the campaign: Measuring campaign results and making changes to improve performance. A brief history of advertising agencies  The first agencies date back as far as 1786 when William Taylor opened his office in London, today  acknowledged as the first advertising agency in history. 14",652,106,163.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1526,15,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, while the UK business is considered the precursor of advertising agencies in Europe, it was Volney  B. Palmer who took the idea across the ocean, opening the first agency on American soil in Philadelphia in  1842. Volney would buy large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate, then resell the space  at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad, including the copy, layout, and artwork, was prepared by the  client, which basically made Palmer an ad-space broker with little influence on the creative side. Some agents, at the request of their clients, created directories with advertising rates of newspapers in New  England. Many agencies made a profit buying newspaper space and reselling it with a markup.",740,125,185.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1527,15,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Many other advertising agencies soon followed the same business model until the 19th century when N. W.  Ayer & Son was founded in New York. The agency, rather than simply selling space, provided a full range of services, including planning, creating,  and executing complete campaigns for its customers. It made itself famous working for clients such as De Beers, AT&T, and the U. S. Army, creating a number of  memorable slogans. We talk more about ad agencies in Chapter 04: The Main Technology Platforms and Intermediaries in the  Digital Advertising Ecosystem  Source: Adland: A Global History of Advertising, published by Kogan Page; Second edition (July 28, 2013)  Throughout this book, you’ll see us use the term advertiser , which can either refer to an advertiser working  in-house at a brand, or an ad agency working on behalf of a brand. Why Do Brands and Companies Advertise?",888,153,222.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1528,15,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There are a number of reasons why brands and companies advertise. Below are some of the main advertising  strategies:  Brand awareness: Reach a broad consumer audience, engage with them, and maximize the time they are  exposed to the brand. Direct response (aka prospecting, acquisition): Generate new leads, sales, and conversions by displaying  ads that persuade the consumer to take some sort of action, such as fill in a form. Retention : Re-engage with existing customers and consumers who have previously interacted or been  exposed to a brand, which is very often conducted via retargeting (aka remarketing) campaigns. What is a Publisher?",646,106,161.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1529,15,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A publisher can be defined as any company that produces content that attracts an audience. Examples of publishers include newspapers and magazines in the offline world, and websites and mobile apps  in the online world. 15",222,37,55.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1530,16,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Above are examples of publishers displayed on different devices. Notice how they all have an ad displayed? The term publisher doesn’t solely refer to websites, it can also extend to content or publishing platforms, such  as YouTube, Facebook, and Hulu. How Do Publishers Monetize Their Websites and Apps? There are a number of ways publishers can monetize their websites or apps depending on their strategy.",407,66,101.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1531,17,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This is by far one of the most popular ways to monetize websites and apps of all shapes and sizes. Depending  on the pricing model, publishers can either make money each time a visitor clicks on an ad or for every 1,000  impressions. See chapter 05. The Main Digital Advertising Mediums and Channels for more information about the  different types of digital advertisements. Paywalls and Registration Walls  17",410,72,102.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1532,18,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Many popular news and premium-content sites hide their content behind paywalls and registration walls. Paywalls: Require users to either buy a subscription or pay a one-time fee to access the content. News and media companies are increasingly implementing paywalls as a way to make up for the financial  losses they’ve experienced as a result of ad blockers. Registration walls: Require users to create a free account, or simply provide their email address in order to  access the content. Registration walls allow publishers to collect first-party data and build addressable audiences.",586,92,146.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1533,18,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Publishers can then offer these audiences to advertisers, which can be used for ad targeting. However, this  method is still susceptible to ad blockers. Products and Services  18",178,30,44.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1534,19,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There are some publishers that monetize their websites by either selling their own products and services or by  partnering with other companies and promoting their products and services, for which they would receive a  commission or percentage of the revenue. Examples include e-commerce stores, affiliate sites, industry-research companies, and sites that offer other  premium content and digital goods. Selling Data  19",421,65,105.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1535,20,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Large publishers with access to thousands of data sets and user profiles are able to sell the information to data  brokers or directly to advertisers. Now that we’ve defined the two most important players in the online-advertising ecosystem, it’s time to embark  on our journey through the online-advertising world, starting with a brief introduction about the technology that  powers it all. What is Advertising Technology (AdTech)? The way in which online advertising campaigns are run in today’s digital world look completely different to how  campaigns were run over the past 150+ years of advertising. It’s all thanks to the rise of advertising technology, which has transformed the way media buyers manage,  measure, and optimize online advertising campaigns.",765,122,191.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1536,20,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Advertising technology (also written as Ad Tech, AdTech, adtech, ad tech, ad technology) refers to the  software and tools used to create, run, manage, measure, and optimize digital advertising campaigns. All parties involved in digital advertising—from brands and advertisers to ad agencies, technology vendors, and  publishers—use one or more pieces of advertising technology. Since the very first pieces of AdTech were introduced in the mid-1990s, a number of new systems have  emerged to solve various problems and capitalize on new opportunities that have risen along the way. AdTech has revolutionized the way brands connect with their audiences and helped both sides get what they  want and need:  Advertisers: Want successful ad campaigns targeted at highly engaged and valued audiences with  measurable results. Publishers: Want high percentages of ad inventory sold at the highest possible price with minimal overhead  costs.",935,146,233.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1537,21,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In the image above, the advertiser (The Energy Drink Co.) pays to have its ads displayed on the publisher’s  website (Daily News). In essence, this has always been the goal of advertising, but the popularization of the Internet and introduction  of AdTech added new channels, mediums, and scale, among other things, to the entire process. For example, instead of a brand or ad agency in Chicago calling up the Chicago Tribune and placing an order  for a full-page ad in the Sunday edition with the intention of reaching Chicagoans, the brand could now buy ad  space on multiple publishers’ websites and only display ads to people from Chicago that would potentially be  interested in buying the advertiser’s product or service. These visitors would match the advertiser’s ideal target-customer profile (aka target audience), made up of a  range of criteria, such as demographics, interests, behaviors, recent purchases, and web history. The advertiser would also want to reach its desired audience at the right time, at the right place, and on the  right device—for example, during business hours at home on a laptop, or late-night in a city center on a mobile  device.",1169,199,292.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

They are typically characterized with certain needs or desires. Usually, the target audience can be based on a combination of demographics, interests, and/or behaviors  of the consumers. It’s not only the medium that has changed, but the actual media-buying and selling process has also adapted  to the online world.",467,79,116.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Nowadays, most online media is bought and sold with the use of advertising technology, but it is responsible  for more than just moving an ad from an advertiser to a publisher. Here’s a list of just some of the things AdTech is responsible for:  ● Making decisions about which ads to display to a specific group of users based on the advertiser’s  targeting criteria. ● Delivering online media (ads) across different channels (web and in-app mobile) and devices  (smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc.). ● Optimizing campaign performance for advertisers and yield for publishers.",747,121,186.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1543,23,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An ad slot refers to the actual space on a website that is filled with ads. You can think of this as a dedicated  part of a website for displaying ads. In an ad slot there is an ad tag that communicates with the ad server to  load an actual ad . Ad Space  Ad space is the actual impression available in the ad slot. The terms ad space and ad slot are often used  interchangeably, but the main difference is that an ad slot is where the ad space is hosted.",455,96,113.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1544,24,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To help clarify this point, think about a billboard. The actual billboard would be the ad slot and the white section  inside the billboard where the ads are placed would be the ad space. Inventory  Inventory, aka ad inventory, is the name given to all the ad space available on a website. Sometimes,  inventory and ad space are used interchangeably. There are three main types of inventory: premium , remnant , and long-tail .",426,77,106.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1545,24,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Premium inventory is a publisher’s most sought-after or most-valuable inventory. It is often inventory located  on recognizable publisher sites and typically on high-traffic pages, such as a home page, or in highly visible  areas, such as at the top of a page. Remnant inventory is inventory that a publisher has been unable to sell directly to advertisers through direct  deals and other primary inventory-monetization channels. It’s basically leftover inventory publishers are willing  to sell for less than their standard price. Long-tail inventory is inventory found on small sites and blogs.",596,94,149.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1546,24,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A large chunk of this type of inventory is sold  via Google AdSense. Long-tail sites sometimes seek better monetization alternatives to AdSense, for example,  by joining affiliate programs and networks. Creative  A c reative is the file containing the actual advertisement that the user is exposed to. The most common types  of creatives are graphical files (either static or animated), video files, and audio files, and can come in many  formats, including GIF, JPEG and HTML5 (earlier Flash), as well as MOV, FLV, MP4 for video files. 24",539,93,134.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Display Ad Formats  You would have noticed already that ads shown in web browsers can come in different shapes and sizes  depending on where they are shown and on which device they are displayed (e.g. desktop or mobile). Each type of ad has its own set of formats, most of which were created by the IAB in the late 1990s/early  2000s as a way to create a standard for the industry and make it easier for advertisers and publishers to trade  media.",797,148,199.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

It’s important to note that if a user refreshed the page and saw the exact same ad, then another new  impression would be counted. See chapter 06. Ad Serving chapter to learn more about impressions and how they are tracked. Viewable Impression  A viewable impression is a metric used to determine whether an impression was actually seen by a real  human or whether it was “seen” by a bot or hidden from the user’s view—for example, at the bottom of the  page where the user doesn’t scroll.",604,113,151.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1556,31,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Conversion  A conversion is counted every time a user completes a goal set by an advertiser or marketer. For example, a goal could be to get consumers to purchase a product, sign up for an online service, download  a file like an ebook, or even fill in a contact form on a landing page. The form on the left represents the goal – get visitors to download the free guide – and the graph on the right  represents the number of conversions per month (how many times the free guide was downloaded). Landing Page  A landing page is a web page that an online user “lands on” after clicking on an ad or link. Landing pages are designed to be different than the usual pages of an advertiser’s website, as they are built  with a single objective in mind — get the user to convert and complete a goal, like the ones mentioned above.",822,159,205.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1557,31,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Advertising campaigns usually direct traffic to landing pages to increase the number of conversions, especially  when it’s a direct-response or prospecting campaign. 31",168,24,42.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

The page on the right is  the homepage and has a more general theme with a number of different navigation options. Effectiveness of a Campaign  Throughout this book, you will see us talk about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign . This refers to meeting the goals and objectives of the campaign, whether that be increasing the number of  conversions and sales or traffic to the advertiser’s landing page or website. Pricing Models  There are a few ways advertisers pay to show their ads on publisher sites.",700,120,175.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1559,32,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Cost Per Mille (CPM)  The CPM pricing model refers to the cost per 1,000 impressions; the word mille is Latin for one thousand. The reason we use thousands instead of individual impressions is that the price per impression is very small  compared to clicks or conversions and it would be cumbersome from an accounting perspective if the  advertiser paid $0.002 per impression. Even though the calculation in ad servers and DSPs is done on a per-impression cost (e.g. $0.002 per  impressions), the CPM formula is presented to the advertiser, publisher, or AdOps team so that’s easier for  them to calculate. 32",609,106,152.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1560,33,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Cost Per Click (CPC)  Cost per click is a pricing model used to express how much each click on an ad or link would cost the  advertiser. If an advertiser buys ad inventory from a publisher on a CPC basis of $1.10, then every time a visitor clicks on  the ad, the advertiser is charged $1.10. Cost Per Action/Acquisition (CPA)  With this model, the publisher or affiliate only receives payment from the advertiser when a user has converted  (e.g. purchased a product or filled in a lead form) as a result of viewing or clicking on an ad. This model is often  applied in affiliate networks and isn’t as popular as the CPM or CPC models. Advertisers generally choose the pricing model based on their advertising strategy.",718,133,179.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1561,33,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, if an  advertiser wants to gain brand awareness on a large scale, it would likely choose the CPM model. If it wanted  to increase conversions, it would probably go for either the CPM or CPA model. Did You Know?

1563,34,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:03. The History of Online Advertising Technology  Advertising Moves Online  It was during the early 1990s when many companies, organizations, and Internet enthusiasts started creating  the first public websites. Advertisers soon spotted the potential that this new world had to offer and began  testing uncharted waters. 34",323,51,80.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1564,35,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The year 1994 saw the first recorded example of online display advertising in the form of a banner ad, which  appeared on a website called HotWired (now wired.com). It was purchased by telecommunications giant AT&T  and used to promote its campaign titled You Will. Image on the left: The first ever banner ad by AT&T appeared on HotWired on October 27, 1994. The image on the right: AT&T’s landing page for its You Will ad campaign. Over its three-month life span, 44% of viewers clicked on the banner ad ; compare that to today, where it’s  estimated that online visitors click on about 0.02% to 2% of ads.",608,111,152.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1565,35,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:What is click-through rate? (CTR)  Click-through rate (CTR) is the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times it’s  displayed. For example, if an ad had a CTR of 2%, then for every 1,000 impressions, it received 20 clicks. 35",245,46,61.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1566,36,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This was the beginning of what is now a highly lucrative trade. In the early days of online display advertising, the exchange between an advertiser and a publisher was a  direct sales process and resembled the way media had always been bought and sold. The advertiser would contact the publisher and purchase ad space on its website on a cost-per-thousand  basis, known as Cost Per Mille (CPM) , as mille means thousand in Latin. This system meant advertisers would  pay a certain price for every 1,000 impressions (i.e. 1,000 views). In order to display ads on a publisher’s website, the advertiser would send an insertion order (IO) to the  publisher’s sales team.",666,116,166.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1567,36,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The insertion order defines the terms of the campaign and includes the following:  ● Campaign objectives : Target group, traffic, branding, etc. ● Line items with campaign execution terms : Which banner sizes to use, where to place the ads, and  which pages to display the ads on. ● Business terms : The pricing model (CPM, CPC, etc.)and payment terms. Did you know?",366,65,91.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1568,36,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The terms insertion order and line items have their roots in print advertising. Orders were made for  “insertions” of the ads in newspapers and the advertiser paid a given rate per line. For example, a single  insertion of a three-line item of Business Notice in the The New York Express in 1870 cost 60 cents. Source: Pettengill’s Newspaper Directory and Advertisers’ Handbook  S. M.

1569,37,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The first ad servers began popping up in 1995 and initially were used to control the delivery and management  of online ads. Back then, their targeting capabilities were very limited; they could only target ads based on the header  information that was passed along with an HTTP call from the user’s browser, such as:  ● The language set on the user’s computer  ● The URL of the page the ad is being loaded onto  ● The browser type and version  ● The user’s operating system  The first-ever ad server  The first-ever ad server was founded by a company known as FocaLink Media Services in 1995 by Dave  Zinman, Andrew Conru, and Jason Strober. The company’s name was changed to AdKnowledge in 1998 and was acquired in 1999 by CMGi. Interestingly enough, CMGi was an Internet company in the 1990s and owned many well-known tech and  online businesses, with AltaVista being one of its major portfolio companies. Even though CGMi survived the dot-com crash in the late 1990s and early 2000s, they sold AltaVista in 2003  to Overture Services, Inc, which was taken over by Yahoo in the same year due to mounting pressure from  the board of directors following the 9/11 terror attacks and subsequent stock-market crash.",1213,219,303.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1570,37,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:After some time, difficulties started to arise when the number of websites, and therefore publishers, began to  increase. The once-straightforward direct sales process started to become more complex and drawn-out. While premium ads—those bought by advertisers directly from the publishers—were still common, publishers  soon found that a lot of other available inventory wasn’t being filled and fell victim to oversupply. Moreover, advertisers had to sign individual insertion orders with every publisher they wanted to work with and  coordinate the campaign execution. To overcome these problems, advertising networks (aka ad networks) started to appear.",655,96,163.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

In the beginning, ad networks acted as brokers between advertisers and publishers and enabled publishers to  monetize their inventory without the need for in-house sales or AdOps teams. They would aggregate unsold inventory from publishers and offer advertisers a consolidated and generally less  expensive pool of impressions. 38",400,60,100.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1573,39,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad networks benefit both advertisers and publishers. They provide publishers with a highly effective way to sell their remnant inventory, which could be as little as a  few percent to all of their inventory, depending on how many direct deals they have with advertisers. They also help cut down on the time and money associated with selling inventory to advertisers and offer a  range of services, such as campaign setup, optimization, and technical support (aka troubleshooting). These  services are known today as ad trafficking. Advertisers benefit by receiving high cost savings and an easier, more effective way to connect with audiences  on a much larger scale.",667,110,166.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1574,39,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, even though the introduction of ad networks added fluency to the ad buying and selling process,  many ad networks only wanted to purchase part of publishers’ inventory (i.e. the parts that matched their  campaigns) which meant publishers had to work with multiple ad networks in order to sell all of their inventory. 39",328,56,82.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1575,40,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Not only did this mean publishers would have to spend more time searching for the best-valued ad networks  and pay multiple commissions, it also meant they would have set up the inefficient and tedious waterfall  system. For advertisers, this also created challenges. They soon found that they weren’t able to reach their target  audience by using just one ad network, so they started buying inventory from multiple ad networks. However,  this meant they often bought the same audience more than once, lacked clear insights into the effectiveness of  their ads, and struggled to identify their best-performing inventory. To overcome these challenges, a new AdTech platform arrived on the scene – network optimizers , which are  known today as supply-side platforms (SSPs) .",773,128,193.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1576,40,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Network optimizers allowed publishers to:  ● Eliminate the time-consuming task of managing multiple ad networks. ● Improve page-load time by sending a single request to a network optimizer rather than sending  requests back and forth between the ad networks and the publisher’s ad server (i.e. the waterfall  technique). ● Increase revenue by matching their inventory to the right ad network. ● Maintain strict quality controls by blocking certain advertisers, e.g. ones that advertised taboo products  and services, such as tobacco and alcohol. Shortly after the introduction of network optimizers, ad exchanges emerged to solve the many technical  nuisances found in ad networks, such as multiple redirects, and allowed advertisers to purchase inventory on  an impression-by-impression basis.",794,122,198.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Advertising agencies are generally independent, external companies working for their clients, which can  include businesses, international corporations, non-profit organizations, and governments. Traditionally, brands hired ad agencies to produce television commercials and run print campaigns in  magazines, newspapers, and on billboards, but also to take care of other forms of promotion and marketing. Due to the growth and rise in popularity of the internet, agencies use an array of advertising and marketing  technologies to create, run, manage, and measure online campaigns. These types of agencies are also known  as interactive, creative, media, or digital agencies.",838,121,209.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

These were the humble beginnings of fully fledged advertising companies, i.e. agencies. With time, the agencies would take on additional responsibilities: planning, writing, designing, and coordinating  ads. The first bona fide agencies date back as far as 1786 when William Taylor opened his office in London, today  acknowledged as the first advertising agency in history . However, while the UK business is considered the  precursor of advertising agencies in Europe, it was Volney B. Palmer who took the idea across the ocean to  the US.",775,125,193.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

In 1842, he bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at  a discounted rate, then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad, including the copy,  layout, and artwork, was prepared by the client, which basically made Palmer an ad-space broker with little  influence on the creative side.",839,141,209.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Ad networks were first introduced in the mid-1990s as a way to help publishers sell their available ad inventory  and help advertisers scale their digital ad campaigns across many different sites without having to deal with  each publisher directly. Ad networks aggregate unsold inventory from publishers and offer advertisers a consolidated and generally  less expensive pool of impressions on a cost-per mille (CPM) basis. What Benefits Do Ad Networks Provide Publishers and Advertisers? While ad networks are mainly responsible for helping publishers sell their remnant inventory, they also provide  advertisers with some benefits:  Scale : An advertiser can buy more inventory from many publishers through one ad network and centralize the  reporting for the campaign.",906,147,226.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

First-Party Ad Server  This technological platform allows publishers to manage the ad slots on their website and display ads that have  been sold directly to advertisers (i.e. direct campaigns).

It is also possible for publishers to just use an SSP instead of an ad server, as many SSPs also offer  ad-serving functionality and allow publishers to run different types of campaigns.",439,76,109.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

AdTech vendors need to deliver a high-performance product to their clients and ensure their business model  makes money along the way to cover costs and make a profit. Ever since the early days of online advertising, technology providers have made their money by charging  commissions and fees, typically as a percentage on top of the cost of media. Historically, most AdTech platforms added about 30% to the cost of the media, but this number has decreased  over the years due to competition and calls for more transparency into the cost of media, as well as fees and  commissions (sometimes referred to as the AdTech tax ). Many AdTech companies claim their take rates are now in the single digits.",995,165,248.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1619,65,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:While the above illustration is just an example and every setup is different, this is certainly how an advertiser’s  budget is distributed a majority of the time. The AdTech-tax problem is exacerbated due to the fragmented nature of the online advertising ecosystem  where there are numerous AdTech vendors involved in the supply chain. This not only means that advertisers aren’t getting their full money’s worth, but also that publishers are only  receiving a small part of the advertiser’s budget. Over the past few years, the AdTech industry has started to consolidate.

Native ads are generally found on content-rich sites, such as news sites, blogs, and social networks.",740,127,185.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1632,74,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here are some of the main native-ad formats provided by the IAB’s Native Advertising Playbook 2019 :  Content recommendation ads (formerly known as content recommendation widgets): This form of native  advertising is probably the most subtle. You may have glanced over this type before and presumed that it is  actually content from the website you’re reading. However, the telltale sign is the message above the ads,  usually written as From the web , or Recommended for you . As this type of native advertising appears on content-rich sites, typically at the end of an article. In-feed or in-content ads: These native ads are similar to content recommendation ads, in-feed and  in-content ads.",695,117,173.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1633,75,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Source: IAB Native Advertising Playbook 2.0  In-feed and in-content ads come in many forms, such as content (text), image, and video. Branded/ Native Content: (aka sponsored, brand, or custom content): Unlike the previous two forms of  native ads that direct the user away from the site when they click on the ad, branded (aka native) content  involves companies paying to show their branded content on a website, like a news site or blog, and is  displayed just like the other forms of editorial content on the site. Some great examples of branded content come from Netflix’s ad campaigns promoting the shows Orange is  the New Black and House of Cards :  75",659,118,164.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1634,76,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Image source: The New York Times  Source: The Atlantic  Creating these types of branded content typically involves collaboration between the brand and the publisher’s  editorial teams, leading to more creative and engaging content, compared to the other forms of native ads. 76",277,45,69.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1635,77,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Other Forms of Native Advertising  The first version of the IAB’s Native Advertising Playbook included paid search and promoted listing as  examples of native ads, however, these are no longer classified as native ad types, instead fall under the  Search Advertising category listed below. Video Ads  Video advertising refers to ads displayed in the form of a video, instead of their traditional static form, such as  banner ads. When you think about video advertising, try not to confuse it with television advertising – they are not the same  thing, although it’s getting more difficult to differentiate between the two because of online streaming services. Depending on the channel, serving a video ad is similar to serving an image, text or native ad, except that the  creative (i.e. the video) is sent to and displayed in a video player rather than as part of the web page itself. Also, most video ads are served via protocols developed by the IAB Tech Lab, such as VAST , VPAID , and  VMAP .",997,178,249.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1636,77,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Video ad serving template (VAST)  This protocol solved many of the compatibility issues that advertisers and publishers faced when serving video  ads. VAST supports many different types of video formats (e.g. MP4, 3GP, and MOV), can serve pre-roll,  mid-roll, and end-roll ads, and provides some interactive functionalities like pausing and skipping ads. Video player ad interface definition (VPAID)  VPAID allows advertisers to serve rich, interactive ads to users and collect data about how they interact with  their video ads, such as if users click different tabs to view more information. Advertisers can also collect data on whether users engage with different elements, such as filling in a form,  completing a survey or even playing a game. 77",751,123,187.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1637,78,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In 2017, the IAB Tech Lab announced that it would retire the VPAID standard and replace it with the Secure  Interactive Media Interface Definition (SIMID) for providing interactive functionalities and the Open  Measurement Interface Definition (OMID) for attribution. Here’s a look at how these standards can be used for video advertising:  Video multiple ad playlist (VMAP)  VMAP allows content creators – i.e. those creating the video – to specify where the ad breaks should be  placed. This is especially useful for video-content creators who want to control the video experience but don’t  control the actual video player. Thanks to VMAP, video-content creators can define the following:  ● Ad breaks within their content  ● Timing for each break  ● How many breaks are available  ● How many ads are allowed in each break  Rich Media Ads  Rich media is an interactive form of advertising and can include animated images (e.g. gifs), audio files, and  videos. 78",965,168,241.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1638,79,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Unlike traditional text and image ads, rich-media ads often include elements that allow the user to interact with  the ad, like the ones listed in Google’s Rich Media Showcase :  Rich-media ads come in many different formats , such as:  ● Banners : Similar to the standard text banners, but with interactive elements. ● Expanding : Ads that start off as normal banner ads, but then expand when the user clicks on them. These ads can expand in different directions, such as from right to left or top to bottom. ● Interstitials : Rich-media ads that float on top of the page’s content. ● Lightboxes: These ads are similar to expanding ads in that they expand and often take over the whole  screen when a user interacts (e.g. hovers over the ad for at least two seconds) or clicks on the ad.",788,146,197.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1639,79,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ads are typically created and displayed using HTML5 or JavaScript and can utilize VAST or the mobile rich  media ad interface definition (MRAID) – another IAB standard. MRAID is an application programming interface (API) used to display rich-media ads in mobile apps. Because mobile apps can be built using different programming languages and run on different operating  systems, MRAID provides a standard framework that allows content creators and advertisers to run rich-media  ads across all mobile devices and apps. Audio Ads  While text, image and video ads have dominated the online-advertising scene for over a decade, new  advertising mediums are gaining popularity, with audio ads as a prime example. Due to the rise in popularity of podcasts, music-streaming services, and digital radio, audio ads are quickly  becoming a new advertising medium for brands and advertisers.",886,142,221.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1640,80,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Due to the similarities between video and audio files, publishers and advertisers can use the latest version of  VAST (4.1) to serve ads and collect relevant data. Once upon a time, there was a separate standard for serving audio ads – digital audio ad serving template  (DAAST) – but this has since merged into VAST 4.1. Just like with other digital advertising mediums, audio ads also come in different formats:  Companion/banner ads: Just like the banner ads you see on web pages and mobile apps, companion or  banner ads can appear on the screen when the user is listening to an audio track (e.g. a podcast or music). Source: Spotify  Ad pods: Similar to the ad pods used in video advertising, these can be used to run one or more audio ads in  an audio file and can appear as pre-roll (before the content) and mid-roll (in-content) ads. 80",844,155,211.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1641,81,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Source: Clearcode  Dynamic ads: Compared to static audio ads that are designed to announce the same message to the masses,  dynamic ads change based on the information known about the user, their location, the time of day, and even  the weather. Advertising Channels  Web Advertising  Web advertising has established roots in online advertising. It was the first channel available to brands and  agencies when the world went online back in the late 1990s. This channel refers to advertisements displayed in web browsers on desktops, laptops and mobile devices  (smartphones and tablets). Displaying ads – whether they are text, image, or video ads – in web browsers involves adding a piece of  HTML or JavaScript to a page’s content.",733,126,183.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Source: dictionary.cambridge.org  Mobile App Advertising  Mobile app (aka in-app mobile) advertising relates to displaying ads inside mobile apps on smartphones and  tablets. Unlike web advertising on mobile devices that uses a browser to display ads, mobile apps need to use a  software-development kit (SDK) to display ads. The mobile app’s developers integrate the given AdTech vendor’s SDK into their app, define the ad space  where the ads will run, and then select the ad medium (e.g. text, image, native, and video) and the ad format  (e.g. interstitial and banner). 82",641,108,160.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1644,83,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An example of an expanding image ad inside a mobile app. Social Media Advertising  Although social media networks like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter fall into web advertising and mobile-app  advertising categories, they are their own advertising channels. Many popular social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Instagram utilize native  advertising, where the ads appear in and next to the news feed, making them look like organic content:  83",469,74,117.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1645,84,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Examples of social media advertising. Advertising on social media platforms provides brands, advertisers and agencies with a number of advantages:  ● Advertisers can retarget users using the email address they provided to a brand, which often results in  high conversions. ● Some social media platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, collect detailed demographic and  behavioral data – including a person’s name, age, location, interests, and education – providing brands  with powerful audience-targeting capabilities. ● Compared to other advertising channels, such as display or video, social media advertising can be  more cost-effective in terms of both reach and conversions. ● Because most ads that run within social media platforms are native ads, they often receive more  engagement (viewable impressions, clicks, likes, etc.)",835,127,208.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1646,85,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Advanced TV Advertising (OTT, Connected TV, and Addressable TV)  TV advertising has long been the cornerstone of many brands and agencies. The ability to reach a large  audience with an engaging and often entertaining message helps increase brand awareness and drive sales. Even though traditional TV is still alive and well, new forms of TV are starting to form, bringing with them new  opportunities and benefits for brands and agencies. These new forms of TV include:  Advanced TV: A term coined by the IAB referring to any form of TV other than the traditional broadcast, cable  and satellite connections. OTT: Over-the-top (OTT) refers to devices or services used to stream digital content to a connected TV.",713,121,178.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Examples of CTV include smartTVs, gaming consoles,  and streaming devices. The IAB Tech Lab doesn’t consider desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and  tablets as examples of CTV. Addressable TV: Unlike traditional linear TV advertising that shows the same ads during a given program,  addressable TV aims to display different ads to different viewers during the same program. It is able to achieve this by using data collected via Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), which includes connected TVs  and OTT devices and services, and set-top boxes.",821,144,205.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1648,85,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, a person living in Seattle watching Mad Men would see a different ad than a person living in  Portland who is also watching Mad Men . All of the above offer a number of new advantages for advertisers that are unattainable with traditional TV,  such as targeting, attribution and measurement. However, due to numerous technological barriers, the industry is still a few years away from delivering these  new advantages at scale and with high accuracy. DOOH Advertising  85",484,84,121.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1649,86,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Out-of-home (OOH) advertising was a popular medium prior to the internet.

Below are some examples that highlight the possibilities that DOOH has to offer:  Although DOOH is one of the most exciting trends in digital advertising, it is experiencing some initial hurdles  around the media-buying process, attribution, measurement and targeting. However, all of these areas present opportunities for AdTech companies and will likely be addressed and  resolved in the coming years. Search Advertising  Whenever you look for a product or service online, search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo display  a mix of organic and sponsored results.

1652,88,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Both of these factors lead to higher click-through and conversion rates among search ads compared to banner  ads. Who Offers Search Ads? Search engines  Most search-engine companies operate platforms allowing ads in their search results (Google does it via  AdWords , Bing does it via Bing Ads , etc.). This is a natural way for search providers to monetize their huge  user base. While the global search-engine market is currently dominated by Google with an eye-watering 77% market  share (and growing), there are many other search engines that make up the remaining percentage:  ● Google (~77%)  ● Baidu (~9%)  ● Microsoft Bing (~8%)  ● Yahoo !

1653,89,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Publishers  Although most Internet searches are carried out on one of the main search engines, many publishers  (particularly ecommerce stores) have their own search functionalities and allow ads, often in the form of  promoted listings. The search functionalities on these sites not only make finding products and services easier, but also enable  the publisher to offer search advertising to merchants. This is a win-win situation for both the ecommerce store and the merchant (advertisers), as the ecommerce  store is able to create a new revenue stream and the merchant is able to increase sales. Now that we’ve examined the digital advertising mediums and channels, it’s time to look at how these ads are  served and displayed to users. 89",744,125,186.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Ad Serving  Since the beginning of online advertising over two decades ago, a number of technologies have been  introduced to solve the numerous problems advertisers and publishers face and to improve the entire  media-buying and selling process. While the invention of AdTech platforms like demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), and  ad exchanges helped shape the online advertising ecosystem, it’s hard to look past one early piece of AdTech  that is still relevant today — the ad server . Ad servers have constantly evolved to meet the demands of advertisers and publishers and adapt to the  rapidly changing field. As a result, many of the functionalities—e.g. targeting, budget control and frequency  capping—appear in many of the more recent platforms, such as DSPs and SSPs.",807,132,201.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

What Is an Ad Server? An ad server is an AdTech platform responsible for making decisions about what ads to show, serving them,  and collecting and reporting data on impressions, clicks, etc. To help you understand the role of an ad server, think of it this way:  Ad servers are to ads (creatives) what WordPress is to content (articles). In the same way that WordPress is used to manage a website’s content, ad servers are used to manage and  display advertising on a website.",678,122,169.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1657,91,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Publishers, advertisers and ad agencies use ad servers to run multiple campaigns, often by connecting to  other AdTech platforms, such as demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms. Campaign Execution Using an Ad Server: Then and Now  The way online ads have been bought, sold, and delivered has changed a lot over the past two decades, but  what hasn’t changed is the importance and role that ad servers play. 91",418,71,104.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1658,92,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Below is an illustration of how the ad-serving process looked in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and how ad  servers emerged. In the early days of online advertising, executing a campaign was a manual process that only involved direct  communication between the advertiser and publisher. 92",289,49,72.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1659,93,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Then, the publisher’s ad server was introduced to help them run and report on advertisers’ campaigns. Here’s how the basic flow would look:  1. The advertiser and publisher sign an insertion order (IO), which is a document (often a contract) that  outlines the terms of the campaign, including flight dates (start and end dates), placement, ad format  and size, pricing model (e.g. CPM or CPC), and a few other details. 2. The advertiser sends over a list (typically a spreadsheet) of its creatives.",499,86,124.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1660,93,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:3. The publisher’s AdOps team sets up the campaign in its ad server. 4. Once the campaign starts, the advertiser then receives ongoing reports from the publisher about the  performance of its campaign, such as impressions and clicks. What’s the Difference Between Ad Trafficking and AdOps?",289,47,72.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1661,94,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad trafficking is the name given to the process of setting up, monitoring, and optimizing the campaigns  conducted by ad servers and/or other AdTech platforms. AdOps are people who are responsible for setting up, monitoring, and optimizing campaigns. In short, AdOps refers to the people and ad trafficking refers to the process. First-Party (Publisher’s) Ad Server  A publisher’s ad server is tasked with filling the ad slots on a website by matching ads from direct campaigns,  real-time bidding (RTB) auctions, and other media-buying processes. They do this by making decisions about which ads to show on a website based on the targeting parameters of  campaigns set up by advertisers, serving those ads, and reporting on their performance.",743,121,185.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1662,94,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Another feature of ad servers is inventory forecasting, which involves predicting how much inventory a  publisher will have available in the future and the performance of ad campaigns based on current and historical  data. Soon, advertisers started using ad servers to measure the performance of their campaigns for themselves. These ad servers are known as a third-party or advertiser’s ad server. 94",401,64,100.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1663,95,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Third-Party Ad Servers  Earlier in the book, we outlined the following challenges advertisers faced when dealing directly with  publishers:  ● Limited reach of a single campaign. ● Reporting overhaul – i.e. no single way to measure the campaign across different publishers. ● Reporting verification – i.e. no way to verify the reports provided by the publisher. Even though the invention of the ad server solved many of these challenges through automation, new  challenges arose for advertisers.

1666,100,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:First-Party vs. Third-Party Ad Servers: A Simple Comparison  While first-party and third-party ad servers are essentially the same type of machine, they fulfill different  responsibilities for publishers and advertisers. First-Party Ad Server  (Publisher’s Ad Server)  Third-Party Ad Server  (Advertiser’s Ad Server)  Allows AdOps to manage ad slots on the website,  run multiple direct campaigns (i.e. direct deals  between the publisher and advertiser) and manage  third-party tags from other ad servers or ad  platforms, such as SSPs. Tracks the performance of the campaigns across all  the sites that are involved in a particular campaign  (e.g. reach, impressions, clicks, conversions),  calculates the return on investment (ROI) and  attributes the conversions to the right publishers. Helps publishers manage and predict their inventory  fill rates across many advertisers, provides reporting  for billing purposes and tracks their earnings and  actual fill rates. A first-party ad server also identifies  the efficiency of third-party demand sources (e.g. via  RTB) and direct deals, which helps publishers  identify which sources are buying the most ad space  and assign priority accordingly.",1201,192,300.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1667,100,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Helps the advertiser optimize its future media buys  based on past data, identifies which sites and  targeting criteria worked and which didn’t, and run  A/B tests to determine which ads deliver the best  performance. Allows publishers to forecast the amount of inventory  that match certain targeting criteria. For example, it  can tell them how much traffic they receive from NY  State on their homepage’s ad placement so that the  sales team can offer the right quantity on insertion  orders for advertisers. Allows advertisers to audit and verify the numbers  (i.e. performance metrics) for billing purposes.

Ad Tags  An ad tag is a piece of code that is inserted into an ad slot in order to display an ad. There are different types of ad tags depending on their implementation. Below, we list the most common ad tags, how they are used and implemented, and the advantages and  disadvantages they offer:  JavaScript Ad Tags  102",550,102,137.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1669,103,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Usage: For rendering display ads on web pages via a desktop or mobile browser. JavaScript ad tags are  also used for display ads in mobile apps, but generally these will be custom tags or Mobile Rich Media Ad  Interface Definition (MRAID). Implementation: JavaScript ad tags are placed directly in the publisher’s page code. Advantages :  ● Ads can interact with a publisher’s website  ● Viewability can be tracked  ● Ads can be loaded at the same time or after the content is loaded (depends on the implementation)  Disadvantages :  ● Ads can change the content of the publisher’s website, causing it to break its functionality. ● Ads could compromise the security of the website and result in installing malware that captures  sensitive data from forms, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, etc.",807,140,201.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1670,103,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An example of this  is the recent Magecart attack where credit-card details of a possible 380,000 customers were taken  from Newegg and British Airways via JavaScript injection. <script type=""text/javascript""><!--  google_ad_client = ""pub-11111111"";  /* 160x600 - TOP */  google_ad_slot = ""12345"";  google_ad_width = 160;  google_ad_height = 600;  //-->  </script>  <script type=""text/javascript""  src="" http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"" >  </script>  An example of a JavaScript ad tag. Iframe Ad Tags  Usage: For rendering display ads on web pages via a desktop or mobile browser. Implementation : Iframe ad tags are HTML tags that are added to a publisher’s page code. The iframe  completely isolates the code loaded in the iframe, and therefore, prevents it from interacting with the rest of  the content of the website.",846,135,211.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1671,104,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Increases security by isolating JavaScript code in the iframe so that it cannot interact with elements  on the website. ● Ads load after the contents of the website, which helps decrease the time it takes to load the contents  of the page. Disadvantages :  ● Limited interaction with a publisher’s website – i.e. it requires additional JavaScript code to be  installed on the publisher’s website to implement expandable ads. ● Can’t reliably track the viewability of ads. Here’s an example of an iframe ad tag from OpenX :  <iframe id='a62ae7d3' name='a62ae7d3'  src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/afr?auid=8635&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&rd=5&rm=3""  frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='728' height='90'>  <a href='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/rc?cs=acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""  target='_blank'>  <img  src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/ai?uid=8635&cs=acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""  border='0' alt='' /></a></iframe>  SafeFrame  In order to solve the issues related to both JavaScript ad tags and iframe ad tags, a new standard was  introduced – SafeFrame .",1103,145,275.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1672,104,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:SafeFrame is an Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) standard that combines the advantages of iframe and  JavaScript tags and eliminates many of their disadvantages. The SafeFrame ad slots are implemented in JavaScript with an API that loads the actual ads in iframes, but  allows them to interact with its API to expand the content or track viewability. At the same time, it protects the  publisher’s site from unwanted changes and prevents visitors’ sensitive information from being collected. 104",499,80,124.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1673,105,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here’s how the SafeFrame implementation works:  1. The user accesses the publisher’s website and the browser sends a request to the publisher’s web  server to fetch the content and SafeFrame ad markup. 2. SafeFrame (JavaScript) loads an iframe with the SafeFrame API, allowing it to interact with the  publisher’s site. 3.",322,54,80.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1674,105,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ad is rendered and shown to the user. 4. At the same time, data is collected by viewability and measurement vendors to provide advertisers  with reports. It’s important to note that the ad in the iframe loaded by the SafeFrame is isolated – i.e. third-party ad  servers can run any JavaScript code inside the iframe, but it won’t affect the publisher’s website. Only  specific sets of instructions and interactions with a publisher’s site are allowed via the SafeFrame API, such  as data collection for viewability and measurement.",535,92,133.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

It enables in-stream video ads (i.e. ads are displayed in the  video player, like on YouTube) served from video ad servers and played in video players on a number of  publisher sites and on different devices (e.g. desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.). VPAID is a piece of JavaScript that enables video ad units and video players to interact with one another. IMG Ad Tags  105",594,106,148.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1676,106,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:IMG ad tags are HTML tags and are similar to iframe tags. Usage: These ad tags are mainly used to display ads in mobile apps and in the <noscript> section of other  types of ad tags, which are used as fallbacks when the browser does not support or execute JavaScript. Implementation:  Most AdTech platforms and publishers will only accept snippets of HTML/IMG ad tags and not full HTML  code (e.g. no <html>, <head> or <title> tags). See example of an HTML/IMG ad tag below:  <a href= ""https://www.clearcode.cc/"" > <img src= ""http://clearcode250x250.jpg"" > </a>  Advantages:  ● HTML/IMG ad tags are simple in structure and format, meaning they can be displayed in web  browsers and apps without facing too many technical issues. ● They can utilize a content-delivery network (CDN) to reduce the time it takes the browser to load  them, increasing the chances of the visitor seeing the ad.",888,156,222.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1677,106,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Disadvantages:  ● HTML/IMG ad tags can’t display rich media ads (e.g. expandable or interactive ads). Spreadsheets with ad tags  In order for advertisers to keep track of ad tags used in their campaigns, they often create spreadsheets. A typical spreadsheet will include the list of placements and the respective ad tags. Even though this is a  manual and error-prone process, it is still the most common way of trafficking the non-programmatic display  campaigns (i.e. direct deals between a publisher and advertiser) and also some programmatic campaigns  when using self-serve AdTech platforms. 106",600,97,150.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1678,107,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad Markup  Ad markup is a piece of code that’s retrieved from an ad server or some other AdTech platform via an ad tag  and rendered in an ad slot. Ad markup is responsible for two main activities:  1. Loading the actual creative file into the ad slot. 2. Tracking the impression by loading tracking tags (pixels) for measurement, ad verification, viewability,  etc.",366,67,91.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1679,108,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An example of simple ad markup. Chapter Summary  ● Ad serving is one of the fundamental processes in online advertising. ● A first-party ad server is used by publishers to manage the ad slots on their websites, serve ads from  direct campaigns, manage other campaigns (e.g. real-time bidding), and report on the performance of  the ads (e.g. impressions and clicks). ● A third-party ad server is used by advertisers to manage their creatives, send ads to publishers, and  collect data about the performance of their campaigns. 108",530,91,132.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1680,109,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:07. Ad Targeting and Budget Control  In the context of online advertising, targeting relates to displaying ads to users who match a series of criteria. For example, let’s imagine an advertiser who sells gardening products has identified that its target audience  consists of people between the ages of 30 and 50 and who live in rural areas of the US. The advertiser would  then want to display its ads to people who match those criteria. When it comes to direct deals between an advertiser and publisher, targeting was traditionally carried out by ad  servers, whereby an advertiser would define the targeting criteria in the insertion order – e.g. state which  pages and sections of a publisher’s site to show its ads on.",722,127,180.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1681,109,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The publisher’s AdOps team would then configure the advertiser’s targeting criteria in its ad server (first-party  ad server). Even though targeting is still carried out via ad servers, many other AdTech platforms (e.g. demand-side  platforms and supply-side platforms) now offer targeting capabilities. In this chapter, we’ll talk about targeting in the context of ad servers. By setting targeting criteria for a campaign, an advertiser can choose which web traffic is relevant for them. 109",492,76,123.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1682,110,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Below are some examples of targeting methods in online advertising. Contextual Targeting  Contextual targeting allows advertisers to display relevant ads based on the website’s content rather than data  about the visitor. This method of targeting is widely used in magazines and newspapers. Contextual ads are a way to precisely target the ad without excessive need for personal data. Many advertisers and publishers use contextual targeting, either in isolation or in combination with other  targeting methods, because it’s very effective for specific kinds of content.",570,87,142.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1683,111,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In contextual targeting, every element of the process uses information about the website and page to determine  which ads to display. A step-by-step explanation of how contextual targeting works:  1. A web crawler scans URLs and categorizes the content and ad placements. 2. When a visitor accesses a website, information associated with the URL is passed to the ad server via  the ad request.",393,67,98.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1684,111,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:3. This ad request and the contextual information is passed on to other AdTech platforms, such as ad  exchanges and supply-side platforms. 4. The ad exchanges and supply-side platforms relay this information to demand-side platforms, which  then bid on the impression. 5.",271,44,67.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1685,112,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Benefits of Contextual Targeting  Although contextual targeting may seem rather simple compared to other targeting methods, it provides  advertisers and publishers with a number of benefits:  ● Most contextual ads don’t rely on personal data, helping advertisers and publishers reduce their  exposure to privacy and data-protection regulations, like the GDPR. ● Contextual ads can offer safer brand protection. ● They have shown they can increase purchase intent by 63%. ● They are found to be less unnerving than behaviorally targeted ads, while still being based on the  interests of users – e.g. advertisers can show ads for smartphone plans to people reading articles  about smartphones. Keywords  Keywords are valuable targeting variables for advertisers as they provide an accurate picture of the type of  content the website visitor is consuming.",853,137,213.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1686,112,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There are a couple of ways an ad server can identify which keywords are on a given web page, such as via the  tags used on the page by the editor that highlight the key topics covered in the content and via extracting the  keywords found on the page, usually done either with JavaScript or server-side web crawling. These keywords are then typically passed to the ad tag, so that the ad server receives them in the ad request  and uses them in the decisioning process (when deciding which ad to serve). So, for example, if an advertiser wants to display ads promoting a new smartphone plan, it would target visitors  who read articles containing the keywords smartphone , mobile phone , etc. Ad Slot and Ad Position  Advertisers may also want to display ads that are of a certain size or located in a specific area of a webpage –  for example, ad slots that are 728×90 px and located at the top of the page. Because this type of targeting is quite broad, it is usually combined with other targeting methods.",1007,189,251.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1687,112,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Publisher’s URL  Targeting users based on the publisher’s URL is very similar to the way advertisers target consumers in print  media. By displaying ads on specific websites, advertisers are able to reach a broad range of online consumers based  on their interests, rather than based on their demographic information like age and gender. There are two levels at which advertisers can target website visitors:  112",413,69,103.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1688,113,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Domain  Advertisers can target audiences based on the publisher’s domain name. However, this only applies in a direct  advertiser-publisher relationship where the publisher owns many different websites. This is often connected with run-on-site (ROS) targeting in ad networks, whereby advertisers show their ads on  specific domains. Section and URLs  The advertiser may choose to target certain sections of the site. For example, if a site covers a lot of topics (like a news site), the advertiser may want to only target the  technology section or entertainment section.",571,92,142.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1689,113,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The problem is that usually these aren’t clearly identified by just the URL and the publisher may need to pass  the section name in the ad tag to enable the ad server to use this variable in its targeting. This method of targeting is often connected with run-on-network (RON) targeting in ad networks, whereby  advertisers show their ads on a specific group of websites. IP and Geolocation  Geolocation targeting involves displaying ads to users based on their current location. For example, if an online consumer was reading news articles on a laptop in Chicago, they could very well see  ads promoting shops, restaurants and services in the Chicago area. But how do advertisers know where consumers are located?",713,122,178.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1690,113,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An ad server receives a request from the consumer’s browser, which carries its IP address.

1691,114,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The image above is a query from MaxMind. Native mobile apps can also pass the exact longitude and latitude from a smartphone’s GPS to the ad server. In such cases, the ad server is capable of targeting the users within a radius of a certain point (e.g. within five  miles of a given point of sale). This makes geolocation targeting much more accurate and precise than the IP  address method. However, even GPS information can sometimes be inaccurate and even fraudulent.",470,83,117.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1692,114,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To improve the accuracy of location data, some data companies collect, aggregate, and combine different data  points and sensors. Imagine this situation: A consumer is eating a sandwich on a bench in downtown New York and playing a  game on their smartphone. Starbucks (i.e. the advertiser) could display an ad to that consumer encouraging  them to visit the Starbucks cafe located five minutes down the road from the consumer’s location. Browser Type, Operating System and Device Type  Every ad request to the ad server carries a user-agent HTTP header, e.g.:  User-agent: Mozilla/ 5.0 (Macintosh ; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,  like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.101 Safari/537.36  This is Mac OS X 10.12 .6 running Chrome 60.0 .3112.101  In the example above, 14D27 identifies as an iPhone 7 Plus, and we see it’s running iOS 10.2.1. From this information, we can parse the operating system, browser type and version, and can detect the  device type, brand and model (in the case of mobile devices, as shown above with the iPhone).",1050,178,262.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

IAB Content Taxonomy  The IAB provides a standard for the categorization of websites. Advertisers are able to purchase digital ad space based on the categories supplied in the ad request, and can  also choose not to show their ads on websites based on the categories.

For example, an advertiser that works for a large pizza restaurant could advertise its Friday night specials on  Friday afternoons between 3–8pm. This would work out to be especially beneficial if its ad was being displayed  next to competitors that weren’t offering any special promotions targeted for that particular day. Similarly, if a brand notices that ad engagement is higher at certain times of day, then it could opt to display ads  to its audiences at those times.",755,135,188.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1697,118,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Behavioral Targeting  Behavioral targeting, also known as online behavioral advertising (OBA), allows advertisers and publishers to  display relevant ads and marketing messages to users based on their web-browsing behavior. The types of data collected for behavioral targeting include:  ● Pages viewed  ● Previous search terms  ● Amount of time spent on a website  ● Ads and buttons clicked  ● Content viewed and downloaded  ● Purchases  ● Date of the last website visit  ● Other information about their interactions with various websites  118",543,93,135.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1698,119,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Online behavioral targeting uses information about the user to determine which ads to display. The behavioral targeting process consists of three main steps:  119,162,25,40.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1699,120,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:1. Data Collection  Advertisers, publishers, and DMPs collect data about the actions users carry out across different websites. This data is often referred to as event data and includes page views, products views, products purchased, and  other interactions on a website or mobile app. This data is then tied together via identifiers stored inside  third-party and first-party cookies in web browsers, or mobile IDs in mobile apps. User profiles are then created to store a given user’s event data in one place and assign all future event data  to that user profile.",566,96,141.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1700,120,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An identifier, such as an ID in a third-party cookie or a mobile ID, would be used to link a  user with their actions across different websites and assign the event data to the right user profile. 2. Audience Creation  Advertisers and publishers then create audiences that are made up of individual user profiles. For example, an advertiser could create an audience that includes people who have viewed a given product  more than three times in a month, signed up for a newsletter, and have visited their website at least 15 times in  the past 60 days. 3.",555,102,138.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1701,120,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Application of Data  The advertiser then uses those audiences for ad targeting in its online media campaigns, resulting in the ads  being more relevant to the users and increasing the chances of them converting (e.g. purchasing a product).

1702,121,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Benefits of Behavioral Targeting  The amount of data marketers have about users allows them to create very detailed profiles and display ads  relevant to each audience accordingly. The premise behind behavioral targeting is that it benefits the visitor as much as it benefits the website  displaying the ads – i.e users are shown ads that they are actually interested in, which improves the user  experience of the website. However, online users have become aware of how online advertising companies collect and use their data,  which has resulted in some users becoming concerned about this type of targeting and resulted in the rise of  ad-blocking software. Challenges of Behavioral Targeting and the Impact of the GDPR  With privacy laws like the General Data-Protection Regulation (GDPR) in effect, this targeting method became  challenged by stricter rules concerning storing cookies in a user’s browser. The EU law forced marketers to reduce their dependence on behavioral data and look for new targeting  methods that don’t rely heavily on collecting and using personal data.",1083,178,270.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1703,121,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In addition to privacy laws, there are also privacy settings in popular web browsers, such as Safari’s Intelligent  Tracking Prevention (ITP) and Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) , that block third-party cookies by  default and put restrictions on other types of cookies. Google Chrome, which is the most popular web browser  globally, will also turn off support for third-party cookies in 2022. In addition to the privacy changes in web browsers, Apple has made some changes to how its identifier for  advertisers (IDFA) can be accessed by app developers and AdTech companies to increase user privacy. These privacy changes make running behavioral advertising campaigns extremely limited, if not impossible. In a privacy-first world, some advertising platforms that previously prided themselves on their  behavioral-targeting capabilities are now turning to contextual advertising, where the power lies in minimized  reliance on personal data.",956,146,239.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1704,121,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, due to the huge time, cost and resource investments AdTech and data-collection companies have  made in collecting and using behavioral data, this shift is a slow one. Please refer to chapter 14. User Privacy in Digital Advertising for more information about these privacy  topics. Retargeting  Retargeting involves showing ads to online visitors who have interacted with the brand in the past. For example, if an online visitor views a pair of shoes, then they’ll likely see the same pair of shoes (or even  different ones) advertised on different websites.",566,94,141.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1705,122,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The process works by placing a 1×1 transparent image (a pixel) on a website. Then, when the page loads, the  pixel sends a request to an AdTech platform (e.g. a demand-side platform) to retrieve the 1×1 transparent  image. As the image is returned to the web browser, the DSP creates a cookie, if one wasn’t created previously, and  saves it on the visitor’s device. Then, when the visitor accesses a different website, the DSP is able to identify that user and show them the  retargeted ad – i.e. the shoes they viewed on the previous website. Here’s a visual representation of how retargeting works:  122",606,110,151.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

The shopper leaves shoeholics.com and visits a different website — news.com — and sees an ad for  the exact same pair of shoes that they were looking at previously. The DSP is able to identify the same visitors across different websites by syncing cookies with other AdTech  platforms – for example, supply-side platforms (SSPs) and ad exchanges. Similarly to behavioral targeting, many online visitors have come to dislike retargeted ads, as they appear to  “follow” visitors around the internet.",718,118,179.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Demographic  Demographic targeting is one of the most powerful forms of targeting and can be used in combination with  other methods to really refine the targeting criteria. At the same time, it’s very tricky because most publishers  don’t ask nor collect this type of information from their visitors, except for companies like Facebook and  Google. Examples of demographic information include, but are not limited to:  ● Age  ● Gender  ● Annual income  ● Marital status  ● Parental status  ● Occupation  So, for example, if an advertiser wanted to display ads promoting baby products to female users, between 20  and 40 years of age, who have one child or more, it could use demographic targeting and other targeting  methods to display ads to the right visitors.",886,158,221.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1712,126,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Budget Capping  Adding a budget cap to an ad campaign sets a limit on how much money will be spent. For example, you could set a daily budget cap of $150, meaning that once the campaign has spent that  amount of money, no more ads will be shown that day. Limiting a campaign’s budget involves putting a total and daily cap on the amount of money a campaign  spends. In this case, once the daily budget has been spent, the campaign will stop for that day. Some platforms will add a certain percentage (e.g. 20%) on top of the daily budget to help advertisers get the  most out of their campaign  The image above illustrates how a maximum daily budget could be spent.",665,128,166.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1713,126,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The daily cap can be larger to make up for the under-delivery of ads on certain days, but it may cause the  campaign to stop prematurely. Budget Distribution (aka Pacing)  Pacing refers to how quickly or slowly the budget of the campaign is spent, which impacts how many  impressions are served to online consumers over any given period during the campaign’s lifetime. 126",372,66,93.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1714,127,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, you may want to get your ads in front of as many consumers as quickly as you can, so you would  choose to deliver the maximum number of impressions as soon as possible, known as ASAP pacing . Alternatively, you may choose to distribute your ads evenly and allow them to run for the duration of the  campaign’s proposed dates, known as uniform pacing . Examples of ASAP and uniform pacing:  In the real world, pacing also has to account for the fluctuation of ad traffic throughout the day and the  availability of the ad impressions matching the campaign’s targeting criteria. Ad platforms can adjust the speed in which they spend the campaign budget based on performance,  availability of traffic, and price of the inventory/audience:  127",753,134,188.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1715,128,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Frequency Capping  Frequency capping involves limiting the number of times the same ad is shown to a given visitor. For example: three impressions per visitor per 24 hours. Frequency capping is important because it:  ● Limits budget waste. ● Helps to improve a campaign’s overall reach. ● Prevents so-called “overexposure” (a user’s frustration over seeing the ad multiple times).,380,61,95.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1716,129,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An example of implementing frequency capping in Google Ads. Let’s see a frequency-capping example:  Three impressions per visitor per 24 hours  Each time frequency capping is evaluated, the number of impressions within the period of time is counted. For a 24-hour cap of three impressions, the impressions could fire at 7:00, 19:00, 1:00 the next day and 10:00  the next day. The user will never see the same ad more than three times within a 24-hour period. 129",462,81,115.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1717,130,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How Is Frequency Capping Implemented? First, the ad server registers and stores the number of times an ad (impression) from a particular campaign is  displayed to a consumer based on their identifiers (e.g. cookies, device IDs, device fingerprints, etc.). Then, it stores this information server-side (i.e. in the ad server) along with the user’s identifier. This information is often referred to as user profiles on AdTech platforms. Every user profile contains the information associated with the given cookie ID or device ID, such as the ads  that the user was exposed to.",575,94,143.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1718,130,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:They are typically stored in in-memory or other fast-access databases so that the information can be quickly  fetched during the decisioning process of the ad server. Why not store this information client-side (i.e. in a third-party cookie)?Here are a couple of reasons:  ● The cookie size would dramatically increase. Instead of storing a single ID, we would have to store  each ad ID with the corresponding impressions and their time. ● It’s not portable to other visitor-identification technologies, such as device IDs (AdID / IDFA).",536,88,134.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1722,132,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Impression Tracking  Impression tracking is quite simply tracking the number of impressions each ad receives. An impression is counted each time it is displayed to a user. For example, if a user visits a web page and sees an ad, then reloads the page and sees the exact same ad  again, two impressions would be counted. The most popular method of counting an impression is to serve a 1×1 transparent image that notifies the ad  server of an impression. It’s called an impression tracker (or impression pixel ).",510,91,127.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1723,132,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ad server returns a pixel in the ad markup to count the impression when the browser renders the ad  markup – as opposed to counting it when the ad server selects the ad – and returns the ad markup to the  browser. This way, the ad impression is counted when the browser loads the creative. Here’s an example of an impression tracker from the Google Ad Manager ad server (formerly DoubleClick For  Publishers):  132",418,79,104.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1724,133,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ad server can include a number of additional pixels in the ad markup from third-party AdTech platforms in  order to count the impression in multiple systems – e.g. a third-party ad server used only for measurement or  an ad-verification platform. This process of loading other tags or pixels making calls to other platforms is known as piggybacking . There are two main methods of counting an impression in both the publisher’s and advertiser’s ad servers:  Method 1  The publisher’s ad server includes two 1×1 pixels in the ad markup. The first pixel sends a request to the publisher’s ad server, which counts the impression, and the second  pixel sends a request to the advertiser’s ad server, which also counts the impression. Both pixels are sent to their respective ad servers at the same time.",803,140,200.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1725,133,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Impression tracking: Method 1  Method 2  Both the publisher’s and the advertiser’s ad servers count the impression only when their respective ad  servers have received a request for an ad. 133,192,34,48.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1726,134,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Impression tracking: Method 2  Click Tracking  Tracking the number of clicks an ad receives is typically done via a click tracker. A click tracker is the URL of the ad server’s redirect service, which counts the click and redirects the visitor to  the final landing page of the campaign. The ad server returns the click tracker in the ad markup in order to count the click before the visitor is  redirected to the final landing page. Below is an example of a click tracker from the Google Ad Manager ad server:  Here’s the basic flow of how a click tracker works:  134",568,108,142.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1727,135,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How click tracking works in a publisher’s ad server. The diagram above illustrates how click tracking works with a publisher’s ad server, but what if the advertiser  wants to track the click as well? To achieve this, they would need to add a click redirect from the publisher’s ad server to the advertiser’s ad  server, then redirect the user to the landing page. 135",367,66,91.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1728,136,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How click tracking works in a publisher’s and advertiser’s ad servers. The reason why the advertiser’s ad server would also count the same click and impression is to verify the  reports provided by the publisher by comparing the number of impressions and clicks, as well as to aggregate  all campaign data in one system (i.e. the advertiser’s ad server). It is possible to add a lot more redirects to conduct more processes, such as:  ●  Ad verification to detect viewable impressions, bots, and fraudulent activity. ●  Tracking clicks in middlemen systems, such as ad networks. Click URL Macros  Click trackers can support passing the destination URL as a parameter (e.g. redir_url=).",685,117,171.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1729,136,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This functionality is  necessary to add multiple click trackers in the redirect chain and pass the URL of the next redirect dynamically  to the click tracker. Typically, when we paste a click tracker in the ad server, we can use the click URL macro to expand the URL  of the next click tracker in the chain. Here’s an example:  https://ad.example.org/click?ad_id= 123456 &redir_url=%%click_url%%  The ad server automatically expands the %%CLICK_URL%% placeholder to the next click tracker in the chain  (i.e. its own click tracker). For example:  136",550,93,137.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

A goal could be to get consumers to purchase a product, download a file, or even fill in a contact form on a  landing page. Each time a consumer completes one of these actions, a conversion will be recorded. In online advertising and marketing, conversion tracking is used to report on campaign performance. Also, it is  used in conjunction with the cost-per-action (CPA) model where publishers and affiliate advertisers/marketers  only receive payment once a conversion is registered.",727,114,181.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1731,137,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There are two main types of conversions: click-through conversion and view-through conversion . Click-through is when a user has clicked on an ad AND converted. To calculate the click-through conversion (CTC) rate, you divide the number of conversions by the number of  clicks that ad received. CTC % = (conversions ÷ clicks) x 100  View-through is when a user has seen an ad AND didn’t click it BUT converted. For example, if they saw an ad for a pair of shoes, but instead of clicking on the ad and purchasing them, they  went to the website directly and purchased them.",572,103,143.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1732,137,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To calculate the view-through conversion (VTC) rate, you divide the number of conversions by the number of  impressions the ad received. VTC % = (conversions ÷ impressions) x 100  The CTC and VTC rates will vary widely from one advertiser to another, as there are a number of factors at  play, such as the product or service the advertiser is promoting and the audience exposed to the ads. What is an attribution window? With both conversion models, there is something called an attribution window , which refers to the time  between when a user first saw or clicked on the ad and the time they actually converted. The attribution window varies between advertisers, but it can be anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days.",714,128,178.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1733,137,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Finding the right attribution-window time frame can be tricky because the longer an attribution window is, the  less accurate the attribution becomes. It can be difficult to know whether a user converted because they saw an ad 30 days before the conversion  or because they were persuaded to convert via some other advertising channel. 137",339,57,84.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1734,138,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Similarly, if the attribution window is too short, it could exclude some users who were exposed to the ad and  converted as a result of seeing the ad. This not only affects the advertiser’s attribution reports, but also  impacts the publisher’s potential revenue. The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of conversions are as follows:  Click-through conversion  View-through conversion  Advantages  Allows advertisers to accurately  attribute the clicks to conversions,  leaving little or no room for  inaccurate reporting. Depending on the product or  service being promoted, this type  of conversion can work better for  middle- and top-funnel campaigns  than for click-through conversions. Disadvantages  One of the main disadvantages of  this method has more to do with  the attribution model than the  click-through conversion itself.",851,141,212.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1735,138,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, if you use the first or  last click-attribution model, it can  be hard to know if that click was  the event that actually influenced  the user to convert. It’s possible that the ad was  displayed to the user, but they  may not have actually seen it (the  ad might not have been in the  viewport of the browser) or been  influenced by it. In other words, it’s  possible to attribute too many  conversions to the campaign. Conversion attribution may be lost  if a visitor deletes their cookies in  the time between seeing the ad  and converting. This method is also more prone to  fraud.",598,121,149.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1736,138,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, it’s possible  that the pixel could be fired without  the actual creative being shown. Then, if the user coverts, it will be  recorded as a view-through  conversion, despite the user never  actually seeing the ad. These two types of conversions are part of a larger and broader field of online advertising and marketing  known as attribution, which takes into account a number of different interactions a visitor has with a brand or  ad. Apart from there being different types of conversions, there are also different conversion-tracking methods:  138",564,98,141.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1737,139,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Pixel Method  The pixel method for click-through tracking works like this:  In the pixel method for click-through conversions, the user visits a website, sees an ad and clicks on it. They  are then taken to the advertiser’s landing page and convert. When the user clicks on the ad, the advertiser’s  conversion pixel fires and records the user’s cookie ID in the advertiser’s ad server. Typically, an ad server will assume that the last click ID for the particular cookie ID generated the conversion. 139",508,89,127.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1738,140,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This way, the conversion can be associated with a specific ad, line item, and campaign (the click ID will store  information about which ad the user clicked). The pixel method for view-through tracking:  In the pixel method for view-through conversions, the user sees an ad (but doesn’t click on it), leaves the  publisher’s website, comes back to the advertiser’s website through another channel (e.g. via a Google  search), and then converts. The advertiser is able to attribute the conversion to the ad that was on the publisher’s website by comparing  the cookie ID it created when it displayed the ad on the publisher’s site with the one created when the  conversion pixel fired on the success page. The Server-Side Method  The server-side method works in a similar way to the pixel method; however, instead of firing a pixel and  passing the user’s cookie ID to the ad server, the user’s cookie ID is passed from the page to the ad server via  a server-to-server call. 140",978,175,244.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1739,141,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This method is widely used in the affiliate advertising and marketing space because it is so crucial to get the  data right and reliably track the conversions for the partners (i.e. publishers) because they get paid only for  conversions. Below are a couple examples to help explain the server-side method:  Example 1: Selling insurance as an affiliate  Affiliate advertisers and marketers are paid on a cost-per-action/acquisition (CPA) basis, which means they  only receive payment, either in the form of a fixed-priced commission or a percentage of the sale’s total value,  when a user converts. However, it could be hours, days or even weeks between the time a user sees the insurance ad on the  publisher’s site and the time they actually convert (purchase the insurance policy). Therefore, the system on the advertiser’s side must track the click ID and notify the affiliate ad network (or the  ad server) about the successful conversion once the conversion is verified – e.g. when the application is  processed successfully or when payment from the user is received. Example 2: App installs  Attributing a conversion for an app install to a publisher or affiliate advertiser/marketer is different than  attributing conversions in browsers.",1246,208,311.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1740,141,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The reason for this is because, unlike web and mobile browsers that are  able to fire pixels, there is no way to fire a pixel in a mobile app. In order to track events such as conversions, the software-development kit (SDK) in the app has to notify the  ad server of the installation, which is then attributed to the app-store redirect generated by the partner (i.e.  publisher or affiliate). A postback notification is sent to notify the publisher or affiliate about the successful install, meaning they have  just earned a CPA commission. The Importance of Properly Attributing Affiliate Campaigns  As you can probably imagine, trust is an issue that often arises with CPA campaigns. There are a few ways advertisers can evade paying commissions to publishers and affiliates, but this ultimately  disadvantages the advertiser as well as the publisher or affiliate.",866,147,216.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1741,141,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Let us explain. In the affiliate, CPA, and revenue-sharing space, publishers can ultimately choose from hundreds of offers to  promote. The publisher’s and affiliate’s goal is to make the most money possible from the offers they promote, so most  of them will test the offers on a small percentage of their traffic and tweak them to find the ones that generate  the most revenue. 141",383,68,95.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1742,142,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If the offers don’t perform well, which could be due to a number of reasons (such as offers not being the right fit  for their audience), they will simply remove them from their site and stop promoting them, which means the  advertiser won’t receive any conversions from the offers. This essentially defeats the point of the whole process. Reporting  The reporting function of an AdTech platform is responsible for displaying metrics about many different areas of  a campaign. The reports are highly valuable for both advertisers and publishers, as they provide clear insights into the  performance of their campaigns and the users who click on their ads. For every impression served, an AdTech platform stores a record with the following attributes:  ● Timestamp (impression, click, conversion)  ● IP address  ● Campaign ID  ● Line item ID  ● Ad/creative ID  ● Geolocation  ● Browser  ● OS  ● Publisher domain  ● Publisher placement  ● … and others  Similar information is stored for every click and conversion.",1012,181,253.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1743,143,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Metrics  A metric is an actual number calculated for the overall campaign or the data matching the specific dimension’s  value. Some metrics can be derived from others; for example, calculating the CTR metric is done by dividing the total  number of clicks (metric) by the total number of impressions (metric):  CTR = clicks / impressions x 100. Examples of metrics include:  ● Impressions: the number of times an ad was displayed. ● Clicks: The number of times an ad was clicked on. ● Conversions: the number of desired actions (goals) performed by a user (e.g. filling in a contact form  or making a purchase).",612,110,153.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1744,143,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Reach: the number of unique visitors/devices that the campaign reached. ● Click-through rate (CTR): number of clicks / number of impressions x 100. ● Cost per mille (CPM): cost per 1,000 impressions. ● Cost per click (CPC): the cost of each click an ad or link generates. ● Cost per action/acquisition (CPA): the cost of each action, acquisition, or conversion.",363,61,90.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1745,143,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:CPA is often  used in affiliate marketing. ● Conversion rate (CVR): the number of conversions divided by the number of clicks (then multiplied by  100 to get a percentage). This model is typically used for click-through conversions. 143,236,40,59.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1746,144,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Amount spent (cost): the amount of money spent for the respective impressions, clicks and  conversions. ● Revenue (total conversion value): the amount of money earned from the conversions. Effective Cost Per Mille, Click, and Action (eCPM, eCPC, eCPA)  In most reports, you’ll see metrics that have the letter e before them. The e stands for effective and is used to determine the revenue generated by a particular pricing model (e.g.  eCPM). Effective CPM, CPC, and CPA can be calculated for any campaign and can be worked out by using the  following formulas:  Effective cost per click (eCPC) = budget spend / number of clicks  Effective cost per action/acquisition (eCPA) = budget spend / number of conversions  Effective cost per mille (eCPM) = budget spend / number of impressions x 1000  As advertisers and publishers select a pricing model before the campaign starts, these pricing models show  advertisers and publishers what the results would have been if they had used that particular pricing model.",1011,173,252.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1747,144,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Very often, advertisers will calculate their campaigns in different pricing models to compare their performance. On the publisher’s side, they may want to calculate the eCPC or eCPA for all their CPM campaigns to see if  they could have made more revenue via those pricing models. For example, let’s have a look at the following three campaigns:  Campaign #1: CPM  Campaign  Impressio  ns  Clicks  Conversio  ns  Total cost  CPM  eCPC  eCPA  Summer  promotion  1,000,000  1,500  10  $4,000  $4  $2.67  $400  Campaign #2: CPC  Campaign  Impressio  ns  Clicks  Conversio  ns  Total cost  eCPM  CPC  eCPA  Summer  promotion  2  1,000,000  2,000  50  $10,000  $10  $5  $200  Campaign #3: CPA  144",692,152,173.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

In performance-based advertising, advertisers will look at the return on investment (ROI) of the campaign and  traffic source. This metric is used to evaluate the efficiency of their advertising budget. It is calculated in the following way:  ROI = (total conversion value – amount spent) / amount spent x 100%  The ROI metric will have positive values when the advertiser is making money and negative values when the  advertiser is losing money. Example:  Total conversion  value  Amount spent  ROI  Campaign 1  $1,200  $1,000  +20%  For every dollar  spent, we earn 20  cents*  Campaign 2  $900  $1,000  -10%  For every dollar  spent, we lose 10  cents*  *This does not take into account any fixed or variable costs that you may have with delivering goods or  services to the end customers, so even a 20% ROI may not necessarily mean that you make profit – however,  this works very well with digital goods where your marginal cost is very low.",1165,237,291.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1749,145,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Dimension and Subdimensions  A dimension is an attribute or variable of data used to break down a report. Some examples of dimensions include:  ● Country  ● Device type  ● Browser type  ● Hour of the day  ● Campaign  ● Line item  ● Creative  145,245,53,61.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1750,146,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Date, day of the week  ● Publisher URL/domain  ● OS and OS version  ● Geolocation  Subdimensions (aka drill-downs ) allow us to view data from a given dimension that’s broken down by  another dimension (e.g. Country -> Carrier -> Line item -> Ad). Filtering  Filtering (aka segmentation ) allows you to restrict the data set that you are running the report on. Common filters include:  ● Date range  ● Advertiser -> Insertion Order -> Line Item -> Ad  On top of that, you can typically apply an include/exclude filter for any value for any dimension, e.g.:  ● Country = Poland OR Germany OR United Kingdom  ● Device type = Tablet  ● Day of week = Monday-Friday  Technical Considerations of Reporting  From an ad-operations perspective, there are some important aspects of reporting that need to be  acknowledged, otherwise the advertiser or publisher could be confused and misled when comparing data from  other systems. Delays  There is usually a delay between the time an event is received by the system and the time it’s included in the  reports. Most of the time, it is a few minutes, but sometimes, it can be as high as a couple of hours.",1145,216,286.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1751,146,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The most recent data is often an approximation of a complete report, and an accurate report is available after  some time. It’s best to check these values for the reporting system that you are using. An example of a data delay:  Report-data approximation is available within 15 minutes of an event occurrence, with an accurate report  available within a maximum of 24 hours. Typically, the accurate report should be used for billing purposes. Reporting Time Zone  When comparing reports from different systems, it is important to determine whether they are both using the  same time zone and that only accurate data is used (not an approximation).",647,111,161.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1752,146,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Data Retention  Some reporting systems handle the increase in data by dropping events older than some threshold age (e.g.  six months or one year). An alternative space and cost-saving technique is to decrease report granularity with  146,238,40,59.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1753,147,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:time. For example, data from the last month is available with precision up to an hour, data from one month to one  year is summed up for the entire day, and data older than one year is only available in the form of campaign  totals. Discrepancies: Trust, But Verify  In online advertising, a discrepancy is the difference between reported data in two different AdTech platforms –  e.g. between a publisher’s ad server and an advertiser’s ad server. It is a very sensitive topic because the data collected by these AdTech platforms is later used for billing  purposes and is often subject of disputes between publishers, advertisers, and AdTech vendors. While there can be a number of reasons for discrepancies, most can be attributed to technical errors.",754,131,188.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1754,147,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A majority of AdTech platforms depend on client-side tracking methods – i.e. those carried out in web  browsers, SDKs in mobile apps, and other embedded devices – for receiving data about events, such as  impressions, clicks, and conversions. The issue with client-side tracking is that it is error prone ( more on the causes below ). In this section, we’ll answer the following questions:  ● How can one verify whether a publisher’s ad server or an advertiser’s ad server reports are valid? ● Why are discrepancies inevitable? ● What are the common causes of discrepancies?",574,98,143.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1755,147,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● What is the acceptable level of discrepancies? Below are two images that illustrate some situations when discrepancies are likely to occur:  1. During impression tracking:  147,178,29,44.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1756,148,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The publisher’s ad tag loads and the ad impression is tracked, but for whatever reason, the browser didn’t load  the advertiser’s ad tag or impression pixel. 148",161,28,40.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1757,149,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:2. When counting the click:  A discrepancy could occur if the redirect chain is broken, which would mean that the advertiser’s ad server  wouldn’t receive information about the click and the user wouldn’t be taken to the final landing page. As we can see in the above diagrams, most discrepancies will occur after the publisher’s ad server has loaded  the ad tag, meaning advertisers will often report lower numbers than publishers. Discrepancies and Common Causes  Below are some possible reasons as to why discrepancies occur. Human and Implementation Errors  AdOps are usually swamped with a lot of ad trafficking and last-minute entries.",641,107,160.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1758,149,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:It’s not uncommon for agencies  to send or change tags at the last minute before the campaign goes live. Add to this the manual work that must be performed for each of the campaigns, and it’s easy to make a  mistake, especially by a junior or overloaded AdOps team member. Specifically, common errors are:  Pasting an incomplete impression-tracking pixel that’s missing the full ID: Launching an incorrect pixel  will result in hitting the advertiser’s ad server, but not tracking the impression due to the missing ad or  campaign identifier. 149",546,95,136.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1759,150,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Using the incorrect impression pixel: For example, pasting an impression pixel from Campaign ABC to  Campaign 123 that was kept in the pastebin. Implementing the wrong macro: Failing to add a cache buster may cause the pixel to be cached by the  browser and therefore won’t correctly report impressions for subsequent ad views of the same user/browser. Difference in run dates or failure to fully set up the campaign on one of the ad servers: The campaign  may have already started in one ad server, but may not be running in the other ad server, which would cause  the campaign to not display ads. For example, if the tags weren’t properly set up in the advertiser’s ad server, but were set up correctly in the  publisher’s, then the publisher’s tags would run properly on their site and track every impression of the empty  ad. Configuration Issues  Discrepancies in reporting can also be caused by differences in the reporting configuration between different  AdTech platforms, such as:  Time zone: If one AdTech platform records events in Central Time (CT) and another one in Pacific Time (PT),  then you’ll notice disprecencies when looking at time-based dimensions (e.g. daily and hourly reports).",1203,208,300.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1760,150,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Traffic validation and filtering: Some AdTech platforms use traffic validation and filtering services in an  attempt to block fraudulent traffic, which can also cause discrepancies between platforms. Differences in terminology and counting methodology: While most AdTech platforms can agree on the  proper definition of common metrics like impressions, clicks, and conversions, there can be some differences  in how these are counted. For example, one AdTech platform could count impressions when the pixel fires in the browser, whereas  another could count impressions when the ad is served (i.e. when it leaves the server). In the latter case, an  impression would be counted when it is served, but it might not actually load in the browser due to technical  issues. Client-Side Issues  As we mentioned above, most AdTech platforms rely on client-side tracking for reporting, but often encounter a  number of technical issues, such as:  ● Poor Internet connectivity and latency.",980,158,245.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1761,150,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● JavaScript errors could be breaking the execution of the ad code. ● The browser could be set to disable JavaScript or use extensions like <noscript>. ● The URL’s maximum length could have been reached, meaning some redirect paths could be cut off  and not executed. ● Special characters passed in the URL might not be parsed correctly by the AdTech platform. ● The creative’s file size could be too big or might not comply with the IAB’s standards.",450,80,112.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1762,150,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The webpage could contain large files (e.g. rich images that take a long time to load), which increases  overall latency. 150",127,23,31.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1763,151,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How to Calculate an Impression Discrepancy  Calculating a discrepancy between two AdTech platforms can be done via the following formula:  Impression discrepancy = (publisher’s impression count – advertiser’s impression count) / advertiser’s  impression count  To work out the percentage, simply multiply the final number by 100. Discrepancy Tolerance  The IAB states that a tolerance of 10% discrepancy based on the publisher’s figures is acceptable. 151",455,70,113.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1764,152,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A discrepancy is calculated from the advertiser’s numbers, but if it’s less than 10%, then the publisher’s metric  is typically used for billing. Reconciliation  Reconciliation is a process used to compare two sets of records to ensure the figures are in agreement and  are accurate. Due to the wide-ranging number of possible reasons for discrepancies, most of the time reconciliation is a  manual process whereby AdOps team members log in to their AdTech platform accounts, compile reports,  download the data, and look at where the main problems lie. Chapter Summary  ● The most popular method of counting an impression is to serve a 1×1 transparent image that notifies  the ad server of an impression, known as an impression tracker (or impression pixel ). ● When the impression tracker loads, it records an impression in the AdTech platform.",846,144,211.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1765,152,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Tracking the number of clicks an ad receives is typically done via a click tracker , which is the URL of  the ad server’s redirect service that counts the click and redirects the visitor to the final landing page of  the campaign. ● A conversion is registered every time a user completes a goal set by an advertiser or marketer, which  could be a purchase or a download. ● There are two main types of conversion tracking: click-through conversion and view-through  conversion, which can either be recorded by firing a pixel on the confirmation page or by tracking the  conversions server-side. 152",599,108,149.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Common reasons  are related to human error, reporting configuration, and technical issues. ● The IAB states that a discrepancy of under 10% is acceptable. 153",491,79,122.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1767,154,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:09. Media-Buying Methods: Programmatic, Real-Time  Bidding (RTB), Header Bidding, and PMP  As we’ve covered previously in this book, the online advertising industry is made up of many advertising  technology platforms, such as ad servers, DSPs, SSPs and ad networks. The goals of these AdTech platforms vary – some are responsible for serving ads, while others are designed to  help advertisers and publishers buy and sell online media. In this chapter, we’ll take a look at the media-buying processes that power these AdTech platforms. 154",540,88,135.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1768,155,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Main Media-Buying Processes  Below is an overview of the main media-buying processes that we’ll be covering in this chapter:  Now let’s take a look at these processes in more detail. Manual Media Buying  In the early days of online advertising, the buying and selling of ads between advertisers and publishers was a  very manual process. Advertisers would work with publishers and send them ad tags directly. Because there weren’t any  technological platforms involved, there wasn’t any way to define targeting or produce reports. Luckily, the introduction of ad servers solved this and kickstarted the programmatic media-buying revolution.",644,103,161.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1769,155,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Programmatic Media Buying  What Does Programmatic Mean? The term programmatic can mean different things to different people, but here’s a simple and clear definition:  155",171,27,42.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1770,156,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Programmatic refers to the use of technology, algorithms and data to buy and sell online media in an  automated fashion. Compare this to the manual way of buying advertising, which doesn’t involve the use of technology or  algorithms and is done human to human. Below are some examples that illustrate the difference between the execution processes of manually  purchased media and programmatically purchased media:  Manual media buying  The execution of a manual media transaction:  ● The advertiser and the publisher sign an insertion order (IO), which is a contract that defines the terms  and conditions of the campaign, such as flight dates and placement. ● The advertiser sends its ad tags to the publisher. These ad tags are pieces of HTML that will display the  ad on the publisher’s website.",800,138,200.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1771,157,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Programmatic media buying  The execution of a programmatic media transaction:  ● The advertiser and the publisher sign an insertion order (IO), which is a contract that defines the terms  and conditions of the campaign, such as flight dates and placement. ● The advertiser’s AdOps team configures the campaign in the advertiser’s ad server and sends the ad  tags to the publisher. ● The publisher’s AdOps team sets up the campaign, adds the advertiser’s ad tags to the publisher’s ad  server and starts the campaign. Although the above processes look similar, the main advantage of using ad servers is the added benefits they  provide over manual media buying, such as targeting, placement, reporting, and the elimination of mundane  and repetitive tasks. For example, instead of a publisher adding the advertiser’s ad tag on its website that would simply display the  ad when the page loads, the ad tag could instead redirect to the advertiser’s ad server.",957,163,239.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1772,157,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The benefit of this is  that the ad server could then decide which ad to show the user based on a number of factors, such as location  and device. 157",150,32,37.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1773,158,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Another key difference between manually purchasing and programmatically purchasing media is the speed  with which we can start and modify the campaign when it’s running. Creating and launching a campaign in a programmatic AdTech platform such as a DSP takes a matter of  minutes. Without programmatic technologies, it can take several days before the campaign begins. Also, when buying media manually without programmatic platforms, each change to the campaign has to go  through the publisher’s AdOps team, which can take a few days to implement. When tweaking the campaign in  programmatic media-buying platforms, changes made by the AdOps are reflected close to real time.",675,108,168.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1774,158,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This becomes very important, as brands have to react fast to any changes and optimizing a campaign can be  done on an hourly or daily basis. Campaign Optimization Basics: Manual vs. Algorithms  Campaign optimization involves making changes to the campaign in order to improve its performance and  make media buys more economical. There are a number of areas that can be changed in a campaign, such as the targeting criteria and the ads  themselves. Campaigns can be optimized either manually or via algorithms. Manual optimization  Manual optimization typically involves advertisers adjusting their CPC, CPA and CPM bids, usually on a daily  basis.",648,108,162.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1775,158,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Basically, an advertiser uses data broken down by all the different dimensions provided by the ad platform,  such as geolocation, gender, interests, device type, etc.,and uses those dimensions to extend or limit targeting  to specific groups. By doing so, the advertiser creates very specific targeting criteria that provides the most optimal CTR, CPA or  conversion rate. In order to make the optimizations, advertisers utilize data to determine which bids to adjust, including:  ● The ads’ CTRs  ● The number of clicks generated by the ads  ● The number of impressions generated by the ads  Below is a process media buyers could use to manually optimize a campaign:  ● Start by breaking down the data by one or more dimensions, such as geolocation, device, publisher  domain, time of day, carrier, etc. ● Filter out non-significant data.",839,144,209.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1776,158,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, only ads that generate a few impressions or clicks, or filter  by significant data, such as ads that generate the most impressions or clicks. ● See the best- and worst-performing values, such as device type or geolocation. 158",239,41,59.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1777,159,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Also, you could view certain metrics, depending on what you want to optimize. Examples could include  the effective cost per mille (eCPM) of an ebook download or something lower in your sales or marketing  funnel, such as cost per qualified lead. ● Blacklist the areas (i.e. exclude from targeting) that are underperforming or not performing at all. There are a number of other techniques an advertiser could use to optimize a campaign, including:  ● Running A/B tests: Making changes to the creatives and running tests to see which variant performs  better. ● Personalizing the creatives (dynamic creatives): Changing the messaging or visual aspects of the  creatives to make them more relevant for different segments.",721,120,180.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1778,159,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Examples can include adding a city name  to the creatives so that it matches the user’s location. ● Experimenting with different traffic sources: Seeing how different sources (e.g. websites), mediums  (e.g. display and video ads) and AdTech platforms perform by experimenting with a small percentage of  an advertiser’s budget (5-10%) and compare metrics like the eCPA, eCPM, etc.,against one another. Automated optimization  Automated optimization involves using algorithms to power the optimization process. Many AdTech platforms have built-in algorithms that deliver some sort of automated optimization functionality.",620,90,155.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1779,159,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The key component of successful automated optimization is historical data. The algorithms are only able to  make decisions and optimizations if they have the proper amount and quality of data to fuel them. Programmatic Direct  Programmatic direct (aka programmatic guaranteed, programmatic reserved, automated guaranteed) is a  method of buying and selling media, but unlike RTB, no auctions are held. Instead, an advertiser and publisher agree on the inventory and the CPM, then the rest of the process is  handled programmatically via the use of AdTech platforms. Programmatic direct is very similar to the way media was bought and sold prior to the Internet and even in the  early days of online advertising, but provides more scale thanks to the use of advertising technology.",780,128,195.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1780,160,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The programmatic-direct process is similar to placing an order on an ecommerce platform, but instead of  buying a product, you are buying media inventory. The process looks like this:  ● An advertiser browses through catalogs of websites. ● It chooses placements, flight dates and the volume of impressions. ● It configures creatives and additional tracking pixels. ● It places an order on the platform.",403,66,100.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1781,160,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The publisher audits and verifies the campaign. ● The order is executed without additional involvement from the AdOps team, except for an audit, which it  carries out. The main advantage of programmatic direct is the ability to secure premium inventory at a premium price. Although programmatic direct means advertisers may need to pay higher CPMs compared to other  media-buying processes (such as RTB), they are able to secure premium inventory before the ad space is  offered on an open RTB auction. This allows them to reach their target audience when they otherwise might  not have been able to.",602,103,150.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1782,160,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For publishers, this results in higher CPMs. The main disadvantage of programmatic direct for advertisers is that there are less targeting options available,  as they are simply displaying ads based on the context and known audience of a website. For example, a bank could show an ad about its new bank account on a financial website. Compare that to RTB, where the same bank could show the same ad across many different websites only to  people who had visited its website. 160",478,84,119.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1783,161,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For publishers, the main disadvantage is that they may not be able to sell all of their inventory via  programmatic direct. However, many publishers set up a waterfall to ensure they sell as much inventory as  they can. More on this below. Real-Time Bidding (RTB)  The mid-to-late ‘90s saw a number of ad networks emerge, so much so that by the mid-2000s there were  hundreds of ad networks on the market. However, ad networks soon found themselves falling victim to either underfilling or overfilling ad campaigns.",515,90,128.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1784,161,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Publishers soon realized that their ad network wasn’t selling all of their available inventory, so they started  working with more ad networks. However, this meant adding more tags to their websites, which lead to latency  issues and a poor user experience. To combat the latency issues, a new type of platform emerged, supply-side platforms (SSPs) , originally  referred to as network optimizers. The first supply-side platforms (SSPs)  161",441,72,110.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1785,162,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The first SSPs to hit the market were Collective, Pubmatic , Admeld , and Magnite (formerly The Rubicon  Project). Instead of adding multiple tags to a website, publishers included just one tag that redirected to an SSP. From there, the SSP worked out which ad networks were interested in purchasing the publisher’s inventory  and then finalized the transaction. The mid-to-late 2000s not only saw the rise of SSPs, but also demand-side platforms (DSPs) . DSPs emerged as a way for media buyers (advertisers and agencies) to connect to publishers’ inventory  offered through SSPs.",580,96,145.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1786,162,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The first demand-side platforms (DSPs)  The first DSPs that emerged were Invite Media (now part of the Google Marketing Platform ), dataxu , and  MediaMath . Around the same time, the next revolutionary AdTech platform to hit the online display advertising industry was  the ad exchange . Ad exchanges emerged as a way to help solve the liquidity issues by auctioning off a publisher’s inventory on  an impression-by-impression basis. 162",438,74,109.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1787,163,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ad exchange handles the buying and selling of media between an advertiser and publisher. The easiest way to explain how ad exchanges operate is to compare them to the stock exchange. In the same way stock exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of stocks, bonds and other securities, ad  exchanges handle the buying and selling of ad impressions between advertisers and publishers in real time. 163",406,68,101.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1788,164,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Did you know? In 2007, the three largest ad exchanges – DoubleClick, AdECN and RightMedia – were all bought by  Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!respectively. This ability to buy and sell individual impressions in real time is known as real-time bidding (RTB) . What Is Real-Time Bidding (RTB)?",290,48,72.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1789,164,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Real-time bidding (RTB) is a protocol that was introduced in the late 2000s and was a big game changer for  the way online media was bought and sold. Originally designed to help publishers sell remnant inventory to advertisers, RTB is now used to sell all types of  inventory, including premium inventory. Instead of buying thousands of impressions from the same publisher, RTB allows advertisers to purchase  individual impressions across multiple publishers to reach their target audience more precisely and bid based  on the information known about the website and user at that particular time. Publishers also benefit by receiving higher CPMs for their inventory. What is the RTB Project (OpenRTB)?",702,114,175.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1790,164,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The RTB Project, formerly known as the OpenRTB Consortium and now referred to as OpenRTB , is a group  led by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, consisting of AdTech companies from both the demand and supply  sides. Started in November 2010, OpenRTB provides AdTech vendors with an API specification. This protocol  (known as the OpenRTB protocol) allows platforms to communicate between one another using a common  language to buy and sell digital media. How Does RTB Work? The technical side of RTB is highly complex and involves multiple AdTech platforms.",559,93,139.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1791,165,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A detailed look at how the RTB process works. ● A user visits a page (example.com). ● The page contains an ad slot with JavaScript code that requests content from the first-party ad server,  known as an ad request. The request also passes additional data about the user, such as their location,  device type and operating system. ● The ad server checks if there are any direct campaigns matching the user.",405,73,101.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1792,165,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If not, the ad server returns  the SSP’s ad tag, which will offer the impression on an RTB auction. ● The browser loads the script contained in the SSP ad tag from the server. User information and  placement details like page URL, size, and restrictions are passed to the ad exchange. ● The ad exchange announces the available ad impression to all bidders via a bid request. ● Bidders evaluate the bid request and match targeting parameters, such as page domain, context,  location and other data collected about the user.",522,93,130.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1793,165,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:They then place their bids – basically, they state how  much they want to pay for this impression, if anything. They also send the markup of the ad that they  would like to display. The bid price and ad markup are enclosed in an object called the bid response. ● The ad exchange receives the bids and the impression goes to the highest bidder. The highest bidder  pays the price of the second-highest bid, plus an additional small amount (usually $0.01).",454,84,113.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1794,165,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This is known  as a second-price auction. A win notice containing the final price sends from the ad exchange to the  winning DSP, which is done via a server-to-server request or through the ad markup via a pixel with a  price macro that’s filled in automatically by the ad exchange. The winning DSP’s ad markup is sent to  the browser. 165",339,65,84.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1795,166,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The DSP’s ad markup loads in the browser and sends a request to retrieve the creative (ad) from the  DSP’s ad server. It is quite common for the ad markup to request the creative from a content-delivery  network (CDN) instead of directly from the ad server. An impression-tracking pixel also fires, which  notifies the ad server that an impression has been served. ● The DSP’s ad server sends the creative to the browser and the ad displays to the user. This entire process happens in real time when an ad is loaded onto the page, usually within 100–150  milliseconds .",571,105,142.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1796,166,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To put that in perspective, it takes about 300 milliseconds to blink! Each time a page is loaded or refreshed, a new ad request is sent from the page, which subsequently starts a  new RTB auction. What Information Do Bid Requests and Bid Responses Contain?

Fraudulent-inventory recognition: Because advertisers have real-time campaign reports, it’s easier to detect  fraudulent activity, such as extremely high click-through rates. Many RTB platforms incorporate ad-fraud  prevention and detection software to help advertisers reduce ad waste.

Transparency Issues Regarding Commissions and Viewability in the RTB Ecosystem  Back in the day when the movement of media between the advertiser and publisher was a purely direct  process, both parties knew how much the media was being sold and purchased for. While this direct process is still occurring today, the benefits offered by technology platforms (DSPs, SSPs,  DMPs, etc.)are leading to an increase in programmatic media buying for both remnant and premium inventory. However, even though these platforms are providing advertisers and publishers with an easier and more  optimized way of buying and selling media, they have essentially become the middlemen and are making the  true cost of media harder to identify.",940,150,235.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1801,169,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:When an advertiser makes a media purchase with its agency, it is often unaware of how many hands its  budget passes through, and how many commissions are paid to the intermediaries and technology platforms  before it reaches the user. It is not uncommon for an ad to pass through five different parties before it reaches the publisher. That’s up to  five middlemen all taking different commissions and charging their own fees. 169",430,75,107.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1802,170,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Intermediary Commissions and Fees  Knowing exactly how much commission each technology platform takes (DSP, Ad Exchange, SSP) is  extremely hard to calculate, and even if this information is passed on to the advertiser, it can be more difficult  to validate and confirm. However, a 2020 report by PwC and the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) titled the  Programmatic Supply Chain Transparency Study found that, on average, publishers received just 51% of ad  spent, with 35% going to the intermediaries, e.g. ad agencies and AdTech companies. The report also found  that 15% of that ad spend, known as the unknown delta, couldn’t be accounted for. Some of the key highlights from the report are:  ● Demand-side tech fees, such as ad serving, verification tools and data, averaged to account for 10% of  advertiser spend. ● SSP fees worked out to be, on average, 14% of publisher revenues, which is equivalent to about 8% of  advertiser spend.",960,165,240.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1803,170,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The percentage of ad spend that publishers receive ranged from 49% to 67%. A 2014 industry study conducted by PwC and sponsored by the IAB also found that around 50% of an  advertiser’s media budget went to fees and commissions. We consistently heard throughout our conversations with industry executives that programmatic ad tech fees  are substantial – generally close to 50% or more. These ad tech fees were often referred to as the “ad tech  tax” in our conversations. Ad tech tax in this context refers to the fees imposed on buyers and sellers for  leveraging ad tech technology, and/or value adds from ATDs, DSPs, SSPs, ad servers and ad networks.",656,116,164.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1804,170,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In  many instances, these fees get compounded as fees from one supplier get added to the costs of the next  supplier in the programmatic value chain.

The study went on to state that the percentage varies among companies and may be lower depending on the  number of AdTech platforms an advertiser uses to run media campaigns. For example, an advertiser using just one DSP to purchase media through an ad exchange would likely pay  fewer fees than one who uses an ad agency, which uses an ATD and DSP to purchase media from an ad  exchange.",694,125,173.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1805,170,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In the current programmatic system, advertisers are only informed about the price of the media in relation to  the quantity (e.g. $10 for 1,000 impressions = CPM), but they have no way of finding out what percentage of  that will be taken by the technology platform and what percentage the publisher will actually receive. 170",326,57,81.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1806,171,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In addition to the main platforms and intermediaries, advertisers may also pay for third-party data (e.g.  behavioral and demographic verification data) from a data-management platform (DMP) as well as additional  services (viewability, brand-safety verification, etc). While the cost of the data is usually known to the advertiser, the DSP may add some hidden margins to its  price. Where Does the Industry Go From Here?

Private Marketplace (PMP)  Although RTB helped publishers sell their remnant inventory on the open market, many premium publishers  found that they were losing money on their most premium inventory. Advertisers also became concerned that they were missing out on premium inventory and their ads weren’t  even seen by visitors. To overcome these issues, private marketplace (PMP) was born. Private marketplace is an invite-only variation of the RTB model where publishers offer their most premium  inventory to a select number of buyers.",632,98,158.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

The Publisher’s Waterfall  Waterfalling, also known as a daisy chain or waterfall tags , is a process used by a publisher to sell all  remnant inventory. This process occurs when a publisher has been unable to sell its premium ad slots that are  usually reserved for direct ad sales between the publisher’s internal sales team and advertisers. Waterfalling gets its name from the waterfall-like process for selling inventory; the demand sources are initiated  one at a time, one after another.",1988,372,497.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1811,173,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The advantage of this daisy chain is that the publisher is able to sell off its inventory; however, as the  impressions go further down the waterfall, the CPM price, which is worked out as an average, decreases. The Publisher’s Dilemma: High CPM or High Fill Rate? While ad networks allow publishers to sell their remnant inventory, they still face what’s known as the  publisher’s dilemma – should they sell their inventory at a high CPM and risk not filling all of their available  ad slots, missing out on revenue opportunities?Or should they fill all of their inventory and receive less CPM  for their ad slots, missing out on potentially higher revenue opportunities? 173",676,117,169.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1812,174,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The image above illustrates the risks and rewards of selling inventory on different ad networks. In the image above, we can see the publisher first tries to sell its inventory via direct sales, as these generally  offer the highest cost-per mille (CPM). If it is unable to do so, the publisher will then pass the impression to SSPs and ad exchanges and aim to sell  the impression in an open RTB auction. If the ad space is still unsold, it will pass the impression to an ad  network. How Is Waterfalling Implemented?",517,95,129.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1813,174,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The AdOps team sets up an ad network with a tracking tag that will execute if and when an impression is not  filled. This is typically configured in the publisher’s ad server as well as in each ad network’s system that the  publisher works with in a field called Fallback Ads, Passbacks, Redirects, Default Ads , or similar. These passbacks will need to be configured for each ad network used by the publisher. Referring to the image  above, the publisher’s AdOps team would configure the premium ad network to “passback” to the remnant  ad network . How Does Waterfalling Work?",578,104,144.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1814,174,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If a publisher is unable to sell its direct buys, its ad server executes the first ad network’s tag. There are a couple of possible outcomes, so let’s take a look at a few likely scenarios. Scenario 1  174",205,40,51.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1815,175,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A direct deal with advertiser #1 is able to offer an impression for this ad call, so it sends an ad back to the  user’s browser. Scenario 2  The publisher’s direct deals doesn’t have an impression to offer, so it loads the tag to hold RTB auctions  with ad exchange #1 and #2 , which also don’t have an impression to offer, so it loads the ad tag for remnant  ad networks #1 , which is able to offer an impression for this ad request. The impression is then sent to the user’s browser and the ad is displayed. 175",513,104,128.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1816,176,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Why didn’t any of the direct deals or RTB sources buy the inventory? There are a couple of possible reasons why these two sources didn’t return an impression. These include:  ● No matching campaigns: It’s possible that the advertiser’s targeting criteria might not have matched  the website or user, meaning the demand source (ad network or DSP) wouldn’t have had a suitable ad  to display. ● High floor price: The publisher’s high floor price might have been higher than what the advertiser was  willing to pay. ● Impression capping: Advertisers set up impression capping to limit the number of times an ad is  shown to a given user, so it’s likely that the ad may have reached its maximum number of impressions  for that given timeframe.",739,132,184.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1817,176,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Timed out: Another reason is that the advertiser’s ad server, ad network or DSP may have taken too  long to respond to the ad request, meaning it was timed out. If this happens, it wouldn’t send back the  passback ad tag, meaning the waterfall would end and no ads would be displayed. This situation is one  of the main downsides of using the waterfall option. Scenario 3  If all the demand sources don’t offer an impression, the publisher activates its fallback option. In most cases,  this is an ad promoting its own products or services.",542,101,135.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1818,177,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How Does the Ad Server Know Which Ad Network to Load First? Publishers typically set up a ranking system whereby the demand sources are placed from highest average  historical yield to the lowest. The average historical yield is simply the average amount of revenue the demand source has made for the  publisher in the past. The drawback to this system is that some demand sources may be willing to pay a higher price for a given  impression than their average historical yield. For example, a remnant ad network third in the queue may have an average historical yield of $2 CPM, but  may be willing to pay $5 CPM for a given impression if the user meets its targeting criteria.",678,124,169.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1819,177,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This inability of waterfalling to accurately provide a real-time cost of available impressions was one of the  reasons behind the rise of header bidding. Header Bidding  Header bidding (aka pre-bidding, advance bidding, and holistic yield management ) is a media-buying  process that enables publishers to simultaneously collect bids from a number of demand sources (e.g. DSPs)  before their ad server loads other tags, such as direct deals. 177",445,72,111.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1820,178,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The bids are collected via a piece of JavaScript code located in a website’s header section, hence the name  header bidding. Header bidding came about because of the inefficiencies of waterfalling and also because of Google’s  preferences towards its own ad products. Because many publishers use Google’s ad server, formerly known  as DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), Google favored bids from Google Ad Exchange (AdX). This resulted in demand from other AdTech platforms missing out on the chance to purchase the ad space,  even if they wanted to pay a higher amount for it. How Does Header Bidding Work?",605,102,151.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1821,178,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To implement header bidding, publishers need to add a piece of JavaScript code (aka snippet or tag) in  between the <head></head> tags on their website. This JS code often comes in the form of a wrapper (aka container), which is typically provided by SSPs and ad  exchanges. 178",278,50,69.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1825,182,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here’s an overview of how the header-bidding process works:  Here’s what is happening in the image above:  ● A user opens their web browser and types in the publisher’s URL (e.g. publisher.com). ● The browser starts loading the page. ● The header-bidding JavaScript code or wrapper located in the <head> tag executes and sends a  request to the various AdTech platforms (SSPs and ad exchanges). ● The SSPs and ad exchanges send bid requests to multiple DSPs. ● The DSPs analyze the bids and return a bid response if the impression matches their campaigns.,555,97,138.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1826,182,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The highest bidder wins. ● The bid passes on to the publisher’s ad server and competes with other campaigns, such as direct  deals. ● If the DSP’s bid is higher than the publisher’s other campaigns, it is displayed to the user. Just like other media-buying processes, latency is a big issue with header bidding. 182",317,57,79.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1827,183,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If a DSP, SSP or ad exchange doesn’t respond to the ad or bid request in time, they will be timed out and won’t  be able to submit a bid.

1828,183,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How to Implement Header Bidding: Client Side vs. Server Side  When it comes to implementing header bidding, there are two options: client-side header bidding (CSHB)  and server-side header bidding (SSHB) . Client-side header bidding collects bids directly from the web browser (i.e. the client), whereas server-side  header bidding collects bids from a server. With both CSHB and SSHB, the publisher still needs to add a wrapper or JS snippet to its website. Here’s a side-by-side comparison of how the client-side and server-side header-bidding implementations work:  Below are the main advantages and disadvantages of client-side and server-side header bidding. Advantages of client-side header bidding:  183",710,109,177.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1829,184,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Cookie-matching rates are higher between AdTech platforms because the process happens in the  browser. ● There’s more control over header-bidding wrappers, meaning publishers can easily add and remove  them. ● There’s greater transparency into the demand sources and clearing prices. Disadvantages of client-side header bidding:  ● Because the header-bidding code is located on the page, it takes longer for the page to load, which  provides a poor user experience. ● There may be some browser-compatibility issues, meaning the header-bidding code may not work  properly on older browsers.",591,93,147.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1830,184,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Browsers can only make so many requests at one time, meaning the number of requests sent from a  wrapper or tag will be limited to about a dozen or so. Advantages of server-side header bidding:  ● Page-load latency is significantly reduced because one call is made to a server, where all the bidding  takes place on a server, instead of multiple calls being made from the browser. ● Server-side header bidding allows publishers to receive more bids from demand sources, as it doesn’t  have the same technical limitations as client-side. Disadvantages of server-side header bidding:  ● Because the process happens on a server, there’s less control and transparency into things like  clearing prices, demand sources and fees. ● Matching cookies is harder to do with server-side header bidding, which often leads to a drop in  revenue for publishers because there’s no addressability (i.e. advertisers don’t know or can’t identify  the user on the website).",956,163,239.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Below we summarize the main benefits and drawbacks of both the waterfall method and header bidding for  publishers that want to increase fill rates and maximize yield. Benefits of the Waterfall  ● Sells off remnant inventory that would otherwise be wasted. ● Compared to the header-bidding process, waterfalling is easier to implement and requires less  technical knowledge. In order to implement waterfalling, all the publisher needs to do is set up a tag on  an ad network and in its ad server.",726,123,181.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1832,184,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Benefits of Header Bidding  ● Publishers can receive bids from buyers that may be more interested in their inventory (and willing to  pay a higher price) than the buyers connected to the publisher’s ad server. 184,213,38,53.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1833,185,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The chances of filling all types of available inventory, including both premium and remnant (unsold)  inventory is higher because there are more buyers. ● Publishers are able to get greater insights into inventory value – e.g. if a publisher sets a floor price (the  lowest price it is willing to sell inventory for) of $1.50 CPM, but after utilizing header bidding finds that its  inventory is being sold for an average of $2.00 CPM, then it will get a clearer picture of how much its  inventory is actually worth on the market. Drawbacks of the Waterfall  ● It can produce low yield, as the publisher’s ad server chooses the demand sources based on the  highest average yield, not the current market price of inventory, meaning the price given is the average  CPM, not the true CPM. ● It often causes latency issues, as loading each tier takes time, and the more time passes, the less likely  it is that the user will see the ad. ● Each demand source may fail to load the fallback or become timed out, resulting in lost revenue.",1032,192,258.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1834,185,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Some demand sources require configuring the passbacks in their system, making it difficult for AdOps  to reconfigure and manage. Drawbacks of Header Bidding  ● While header bidding may reduce the number of passbacks common in waterfall auctions, and thus  improve page-load time, it has a few latency issues of its own (mainly caused by adding more scripts to  a page). The latency issue is much less relevant with server-side heading bidding. ● In order to work efficiently, client-side header bidding has to be backward-compatible with browsers  and, in general, compatible with different browsers. ● If a publisher uses multiple header partners, it runs the risk of putting the same impression or inventory  up for sale, duplicating its bid-processing efforts.",765,126,191.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1835,185,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This drawback relates to both client-side and  server-side header bidding. ● Adding additional logic slows down the performance of the browsers and the website itself, which is not  a big deal on modern hardware, but can be a problem on slightly older hardware and older  smartphones. Auction Dynamics: First- and Second-Price Auctions and Hard and Soft Floor Prices  Auctions are an important part of many different types of transactions. They are used to buy and sell houses,  works of art and products on ecommerce sites like eBay. They are also a key part of buying and selling online  media via RTB transactions.",617,108,154.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1836,185,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Since the beginning of real-time bidding towards the end of the 2000s, the main model used to buy and sell  online media was the second-price auction. Second-Price Auctions (2PA)  During second-price auctions (also known as Vickrey auctions), prospective buyers (advertisers) put forward  their bids. The winner is the highest bidder, but instead of paying the amount they bid, they pay the price put forward by  the second-highest bidder plus $0.01. 185",454,75,113.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1837,186,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The price the buyer pays is known as the clearing price . The difference between the amount the advertiser bid  and the clearing price is known as the reduction, or consumer surplus, which, in the example above, is $0.29. First-Price Auctions (1PA)  With first-price auctions, the highest bidder wins and pays the exact amount they bid. For example, if an  advertiser bids $2.50 CPM and they win the auction, the clearing price will be $2.50 CPM. The online advertising industry has used second-price auctions ever since the RTB model was introduced, but  over the past couple of years (since 2017/2018), many ad exchanges and SSPs have started moving to  first-price auctions.",677,116,169.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1838,186,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main reasons for this are to counter the impact of header bidding and make auctions more transparent  and fair for advertisers and publishers. Despite the advantages of header bidding, many advertisers were losing out to direct deals, even though their  initial bid was higher. This meant that publishers were missing out on higher CPMs. 186",345,58,86.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1839,187,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Step-by-step explanation:  ● The publisher’s web page loads and a header-bidding request is sent to an SSP/ad exchange. ● The SSP/ad exchange sends a bid request to DSPs. Each DSP returns a bid response with its  respective bid. Because the SSP/ad exchange conducted a second-price auction, the winning DSP  pays $0.01 more than the second-highest bid (DSP #2), which works out to be $4.01. ● The SSP/ad exchange passes DSP #1’s winning bid to the publisher’s ad server.",470,81,117.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1840,187,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This bid will now  compete with a publisher’s direct deals. ● In this case, the direct deal is higher than the bid from DSP #1 ($4.01), so the direct deal wins. ● The ad from the direct deal is sent to the web page and displayed to the visitor. As the diagram above illustrates, the advertiser (represented by DSP #1) missed out on showing its ad to the  visitor even though it was willing to pay more than the direct deal. This is a common pitfall of the second-price  auction model with header bidding.",504,97,126.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1841,188,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Now, because a first-price auction was held between the SSP/ad exchange and the two DSPs, the winning bid  from the header-bidding auction is $6.00 CPM, which is exactly what DSP #1 bid. Because it is higher than the  direct deal, its ad is shown to the visitor. Bid Shading  While the move from second-price auctions to first-price auctions allows advertisers to win more impressions,  they are now having to pay a higher price. If advertisers were bidding $5.00 CPM but winning most impressions for $3.01 on a second-price auction, they  would now be paying $5.00 CPM on a first-price auction. As you can imagine, this has a big impact on media  budgets and spend.",666,120,166.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1842,188,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:What’s more, second-price auctions give advertisers a pretty good idea of how much the impressions are  worth, allowing them to change their bids accordingly. With first-price auctions, there’s really no easy way for  advertisers to know this. 188",247,40,61.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1843,189,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To help advertisers optimize their bids during first-price auctions and get them closer to the real cost of the bid,  AdTech companies introduced a feature known as bid shading . Bid shading is essentially an algorithm that aims to tell advertisers how much they should bid on first-price  auctions. It does this by analyzing historical bid data, such as how much the impression was selling for, the ad  position and at what price bids are lost. At the moment, bid shading is offered by supply-side platforms and some demand-side platforms. The reason  for this is because most DSPs haven’t updated their tech to handle first-price auctions.",641,110,160.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1844,189,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Although bid shading helps advertisers save money, it’s not a very transparent practice. It’s quite easy for an AdTech company to tell an advertiser that they should be bidding $3.00 CPM when the  actual impression would sell for $2.00 CPM and then pocket the difference. The only way an advertiser would  know the true cost of an impression would be to obtain data from the SSP, which is not something that  happens in programmatic advertising. While most AdTech vendors offer bid shading as a free feature, there’s talk that many vendors will start  charging for this, which has angered advertisers, as they feel that optimizing their bids should be something  their tech partners offer as standard. Bid shading also leaves publishers with less ad revenue.",758,130,189.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1845,189,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Instead of an advertiser bidding $5.00 CPM and  winning, if they use bid shading and win the bid at $3.00 CPM, that’s money the publisher has missed out on. Floor Prices  The contract between an AdTech vendor and publisher will typically specify a minimum CPM price that the ad  network is to offer its advertisers. This guaranteed CPM price is also called a floor price and is designed to avoid the situation where the  AdTech vendor may discount the publisher’s inventory, which would devalue it in the eyes of advertisers. There are two types of floor prices: hard and soft . Hard price floor  A hard price floor represents the minimum price the publisher will accept for the impressions.",691,124,172.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1846,189,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Any bids below this minimum price are simply ignored, meaning publishers will not accept any bids below the  hard price floor. Soft price floor  Because bidders may not necessarily know what the hard floor is, many publishers set a soft floor price to  “catch” any bids that fall slightly below the publisher’s asking price and that otherwise would get rejected. 189",366,64,91.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1847,191,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Any bids between the hard and soft floor take part in a first-price auction. If there are bids above the soft price  floor, they will take part in a second-price auction. Chapter Summary  ● There are many different ways advertisers can buy online media from publishers, such as:  ○ Direct deals : Deals made directly between a publisher and advertisers. ○ Programmatic direct: An advertiser and publisher agree on the inventory and the CPM, and  the rest of the process is handled programmatically (i.e. via the use of AdTech platforms). ○ Real-time bidding (RTB) : Real-time auctions where advertisers bid on individual impressions  offered by publishers via DSPs, ad exchanges and SSPs.",688,117,172.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1853,194,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main browser-based user-identification methods are cookies , device fingerprints and HTML local  storage . Cookies  Cookies (aka web cookies, HTML cookies and browser cookies) are small files that are placed on a user’s  device by a web server when accessing websites. Web cookies were created by Lou Montulli in 1994 as a way to remember stateful information in an otherwise  stateless environment. What that means is that the HTTP protocol , which is the main protocol for communication between a web  browser and a web server, is a stateless process; it can’t store any data or information, it can only receive  requests and respond to them. Cookies are used to help web browsers store data and information when communicating with web servers via  the HTTP protocol.",773,134,193.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1854,195,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:When a user returns to a website they’ve previously visited, cookies will help the website remember certain  things, such as what content the user viewed and which pages they accessed. Some of the main uses of cookies include:  ● Website setup: Cookies can help web browsers remember user preferences, such as language and  currency. ● Sign in: To keep users logged in to their accounts, a unique session ID is stored in a cookie so the user  won’t have to log in to their account each time they open their browser. ● eCommerce: Cookies used by eCommerce stores help web browsers remember which products users  viewed, added to the shopping cart and purchased. ● Analytics: Cookies are used to store a user identifier that collects data about the user’s interaction with  the website under one profile and session, such as which pages they visited, what areas they clicked  on and if they completed any goals (e.g. downloaded an ebook).",936,166,234.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1855,195,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Behavioral targeting and advertising: AdTech platforms use cookies to identify users and show  relevant ads to them based on their previous behavior, such as which websites and pages they’ve  visited. Cookies also help advertisers and publishers know which ads they’ve viewed and clicked on. Cookies have been the most common method for identifying users on web browsers since the early days of the  Internet, however, the rise of privacy laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) and privacy features in browsers (e.g. Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention) are restricting the  creation and access to cookies ( more on that below ). Different Types of Cookies  For the most part, all cookies are the same. However, there are two main types of cookies: first-party and  third-party cookies .",833,138,208.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1856,195,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The difference has to do with the relationship between the website and the server that created them. First-party cookies are created by the domain (website) a user visits directly. For example, if you visit  techcrunch.com , then it will create some first-party cookies and save them to your device. 195",303,51,75.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1857,196,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:First-party cookies are created by the domain the user is visiting. First-party cookies are typically used to deliver a good user experience by remembering specific information  and user preferences. For example, first-party cookies help websites remember the language a user has set and which products  they’ve added to a shopping cart. Also, first-party cookies can allow users to stay logged in to websites and accounts, meaning they don’t have  to log in each time they visit their favorite websites. Although they can be used for online advertising, they are limited in their ability to identify users across  different domains.",633,103,158.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1858,196,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This means that a first-party cookie created by ssp1.com on techcrunch.com can’t be read  by ssp1.com on different websites. In order to overcome this limitation, AdTech companies use third-party cookies and cookie syncing to identify  users across different websites ( more on that below ). Third-party cookies, also referred to as tracking cookies and third-party trackers, are created by domains  other than the one the user is on. For example, if you visit techcrunch.com and it loads a piece of JavaScript from an AdTech platform (e.g.  ssp1.com), a first-party cookie would be created for techcrunch.com and a third-party cookie would be created  for ssp1.com. 196",670,110,167.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1859,197,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because ssp1.com is not the domain the user is visiting, it is classed as a third-party cookie. All other cookies created by domains other than techcrunch.com would also be classed as third-party cookies. Third-party cookies have long been the backbone of online advertising, allowing AdTech companies to identify  users as they move around the web, run targeted ad campaigns based on a user’s behavior, and attribute  impressions, visits, clicks and conversions. However, third-party cookies are becoming less effective due to privacy laws like the GDPR, privacy features in  browsers like Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention and Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Prevention, and browser  plugins like AdBlock Plus and Ghostery. How First-Party and Third-Party Cookies Are Created  The image below illustrates how first-party and third-party cookies are created by web browsers.",878,133,219.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1860,198,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:With the first method, AdTech platforms can either create cookies via the ad creative when it’s retrieved from  their server or via a 1×1 transparent image. The goal of the 1×1 transparent image is simply to get the browser  to send a request to the AdTech platform’s browser so it can create a cookie when it returns the image. 198",332,62,83.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1861,199,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Comparison of First-Party and Third-Party Cookies  First-Party Cookies  Third-Party Cookies  Setting and Reading the Cookie  ● Can be set and read by the  publisher’s web server or  JavaScript loaded on the  website. ● Can be set on different  websites via JavaScript or  by loading resources from  servers (e.g. 1x1  transparent pixels). Once a  third-party cookie is set to  a user’s device, it is read  when the user visits other  websites that also load the  AdTech platform’s  JavaScript or request a  resource. Availability  ● It can only be read by the  domain that the user is  visiting. ● It's available on any  website that loads the  AdTech platform’s  JavaScript or 1x1  transparent pixel.",701,137,175.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1862,199,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Browser Support  ● Supported by all browsers. ● Supported by all browsers. Blocking and Deletion  ● Relatively small deletion  rates. The exception is  Safari’s Intelligent Tracking  Prevention feature that  either deletes first-party  cookies after 24 hours or  seven days. More on that  at the end of this chapter.,316,57,79.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1863,199,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● An increasingly high  deletion and blocking rate. ● Third-party cookies are  blocked by browsers such  as Tor, Safari and Firefox,  and also blocked by  ad-blocking browser  plugins like AdBlock Plus  and Ghostery. Remember flash cookies? Flash cookies act similarly to HTTP cookies but are created via the Adobe Flash plugin, which is used to  power things like videos and mobile apps. About a decade ago, the use of Flash cookies raised a number of privacy concerns due to the lack of control  users had with deletion.",522,96,130.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1864,199,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Flash cookies were stored in a separate folder on devices and could only be  managed via the Adobe Flash settings, meaning that when a user deleted their HTTP cookies, their Flash  cookies remained intact. This led to Adobe and popular web browsers making changes to how Flash cookies were handled. Since  then, Flash cookies are treated the same as HTTP cookies, so if a user deletes their HTTP cookies, Flash  cookies would also be deleted. 199",446,80,111.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1865,200,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For this reason, and because many videos and games are played via HTML5 nowadays, the use and  availability is much lower than in the past, therefore they aren’t used for online advertising anymore. Cookie Syncing  Because cookies created by one domain can’t be read by another, this makes it hard for AdTech platforms to  identify the same user on a given web page. For instance, if a user visits example.com, the cookie that the SSP creates will be different than the one a DSP  creates. To help AdTech platforms identify the same user on different websites, a process known as cookie syncing was  developed. Cookie syncing is the process of mapping one user ID (stored in a cookie) from one technology platform to  another (e.g. from a DMP to a DSP).",753,137,188.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1866,200,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The eventual goal of syncing cookie IDs is to share data about the user  between different platforms, which allows them to better target audiences with online advertisements. The two  platforms would have a formal agreement between one another and would need to set up partner IDs on their  platforms and add cookie-syncing pixels in their codes. The cookie-syncing process is carried out by a number of different platforms in the ecosystem, including  data-management platforms (DMPs), demand-side platforms (DSPs), ad networks, ad exchanges, supply-side  platforms (SSPs) and many more. How Does Cookie Syncing Work? There are two main parts to the cookie-syncing process:  ● Mapping of cookie IDs  ● Sharing of user data contained in the cookies  Mapping Cookie IDs  Each time a user visits a website that contains a cookie-syncing pixel or other advertising-platform tag, the  browser sends a request to a technology platform – for example, a DSP.",951,159,237.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1867,200,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The DSP creates a unique ID for that user, if one doesn’t exist already, and stores that ID in a cookie. The DSP  then redirects (http redirect) the request to the cookie-syncing endpoint URL that has been supplied by a  different advertising platform – for example, a DMP – and passes the user ID as a URL parameter. The DMP’s server reads the user ID created by the DSP from the parameter in the URL and reads the cookie  in its own domain to see if it already has an ID for this particular user. If it doesn’t, the server creates a user ID  of its own, then stores the information about its own ID and the DSP’s ID in a cookie-matching table. The DMP can pass its own identifier back to the DSP so that the sync is bidirectional.",732,144,183.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1868,201,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Now, both the DSP and DMP have each other’s user IDs in each other’s databases. The image below illustrates how the cookie-syncing process looks. Sharing Data Between Two Platforms  Once the cookie IDs have been synced between two AdTech platforms, they can share or request data  contained in the cookies by referencing each other’s user IDs. Typically, this process is done via a server-to-server integration with the data being transferred in large batch  files. Unlike the cookie-matching part that happens in real-time, sharing the data between platforms happens at  a specified time – for example, once a day.",615,102,153.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1869,201,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:It’s important to note that cookie syncing is only performed in web browsers (desktop or mobile) across all  types of online advertising, including display, native and video ads. The reason for this is because unlike native mobile apps that use the device’s advertising ID (e.g. IDFA and  AID) as a way to identify users, web browsers don’t emit a consistent user identifier. Cookies from one domain  can’t be accessed by a platform operating under a different domain, so the only way to identify a user across  different websites is by using their cookie ID. Problems With Cookie Syncing  Although cookie syncing allows AdTech companies to identify users across the web, it has a couple of inherent  problems:  201",715,125,178.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1870,202,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The more cookie syncs a web page needs to perform, the longer it takes the page to load, which can  result in a bad user experience. ● Cookie-match rates vary among platforms, with the average rate sitting between 40-60%. ● Cookie churn, caused by third-party cookies being blocked by default or regularly deleted by users,  means the effectiveness and accuracy of cookie syncing decreases. Cookie Respawning  Cookie respawning is a process whereby a cookie reappears, or respawns, after it has been deleted. It does this by using backed-up data stored in additional files on a user’s device and then respawning the  cookie later when a user accesses the same website again.",676,116,169.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1871,202,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The cookie tags the user’s browser with a unique identifier that is not easy to delete. 4. The user leaves the website and deletes their cookies. 5. The user accesses the website again and the new cookie recognizes the identifier in the browser and  respawns the original cookie.,279,49,69.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1872,202,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There are two main ways a cookie can be respawned:  Flash cookies: Companies use the Adobe Flash Player browser plugin to store information about the user on  their computer and to respawn cookies. As mentioned above, flash cookies are rarely used these days. HTML5: HTML5 local storage and cache cookies use entity tags (ETags) to respawn HTML cookies by  recognizing the persistent identification element (PIE) created by JavaScript and Flash. Device Fingerprinting  Device fingerprinting is a technical process that aims to identify and track online users based on the  characteristics of their devices. It works by gathering bits of information to create an identifier, which is then  used to identify individuals across different websites.",744,120,186.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1873,202,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:While many different users may own the same device, each one will be configured slightly differently according  to the user’s individual preferences and requirements. Data about these configuration changes can be  aggregated to create a recognizable “device fingerprint.” Information used to create a device fingerprint can include:  ● Browser version  ● Operating system  ● Language  ● Items installed (plugins, fonts, etc.) ● Location and time-zone settings  ● Browser settings  202",484,78,121.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1874,203,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here’s an example of the HTTP header attributes that are used to create a device fingerprint:  Check out what your device fingerprint looks like at https://amiunique.org or https://panopticlick.eff.org/  The image above illustrates how unique certain attributes are to the user’s device, as represented by the  similarity ratio. For example, the user agent has a similarity ratio of 0.04%, meaning it is very unique to this user. The more unique the attribute is, the more easily it can be used to identify a user. Why Do Companies Use Device Fingerprinting? Device fingerprinting emerged to address a number of challenges that AdTech and analytics companies faced  around the availability and reliability of cookies.",717,115,179.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1875,203,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Over the past decade, online users have regularly deleted and blocked cookies via ad-blocking plugins and  browser settings to protect their online privacy. This has made it harder for AdTech and analytics companies to identify and track users across the web. Although device fingerprinting isn’t as accurate as cookies, it can be used as a backup when cookies are  blocked or deleted, as well as in combination with cookies to help increase the chances of identifying a  particular user. 203",492,83,123.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1876,204,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How Does Device Fingerprinting Work? Creating a device fingerprint requires collecting data and information about a user’s device, which is typically  collected via:  ● The user agent and accept headers  ● JavaScript  ● Flash plugin (if installed)  ● HTML5 canvas elements  What is canvas fingerprinting? Canvas fingerprinting is similar to device fingerprinting, but only uses the HTML5 canvas element to identify  a browser. Companies use a piece of JavaScript to instruct the user’s web browser to draw a picture via the canvas. Each browser will draw a slightly different image, meaning the image is unique (or highly unique) to the  device.",645,109,161.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1877,204,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This allows companies to identify and track users across the web. This information is then combined and a unique hash is created and assigned to that device. 204,161,28,40.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1878,205,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Unlike cookies that are stored on a user’s device (client-side), device fingerprints are stored in a database  (server-side) due to the amount of information they collect. HTML5 Local Storage  HTML5 local storage is a newer method for collecting and storing data about users. There are two variants of local storage:  localStorage: Stores data with no expiration date. sessionStorage: Only stores data for the session – i.e. data is deleted when the user closes the browser tab. Compared to cookies, HTML5 local storage provides the following benefits:  ● More storage: HTML5 local storage can store up to 5MB of data, compared to 4KB (4096 bytes) for  cookies.",661,111,165.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1879,205,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● More availability: Most browsers don’t delete HTML5 local-storage data and it isn’t typically blocked by  ad-blocking plugins or browser settings. ● No web-server calls: To create cookies, a request needs to be sent from a web page to a web server  and then back again. HTML5 local storage is created via JavaScript and doesn’t require any calls to  servers. The main downside from an AdTech perspective is that it is domain- and protocol-specific, meaning users can’t  be identified across different domains. ETags  An entity tag (ETag) is an HTTP response header used to improve the efficiency of cache and save bandwidth.",626,107,156.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1880,205,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:It does this by assigning an identifier to content (e.g. images) on a web page. When a web page loads, the browser sends off a request to various web servers to retrieve the contents. If a URL has an ETag set for a given resource (e.g. an image), the web server will compare the incoming ETag  with its own ETag. If the two match, it means the image hasn’t changed. The web server will then tell the  browser that the image in the cache is still up to date and can be displayed on the web page.",494,99,123.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1881,205,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:AdTech companies can identify users by comparing the ETags sent from a user’s browser with their records. To achieve this, a publisher would need to install an AdTech’s HTML code on their website, typically a 1×1  transparent image (aka pixel). When the page loads, the code will load and send a request containing an ETag to the AdTech vendor’s server. If the ETag coming from the publisher matches the ETag in the AdTech vendor’s server, they would be able to  identify the browser. 205",488,86,122.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1882,206,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because it’s a standard HTTP request, the AdTech vendor could also collect information about the user, such  as their operating system, browser type, language, location and the URL they are visiting. This information can  be used to create audiences and later for ad targeting. Information created via ETags will be deleted if a user clears or deletes their browser’s cache. Evercookies  An evercookie is a cookie that is saved to various storage locations in a user’s browser and device. It was  created by the privacy and security researcher, Sammy Kamkar.",558,94,139.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1883,206,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Companies can create evercookies via a JavaScript API, which saves data in various locations. If the user  deletes data from one location, such as HTTP cookies, the JavaScript API will recognize that this data has  been removed and simply respawn the cookie from one of the other storage locations. The current list of storage locations includes:  ● Standard HTTP cookies  ● Local shared objects (Flash cookies)  ● Silverlight Isolated Storage  ● Storing cookies in RGB values of auto-generated, force-cached PNGs using HTML5 canvas tag to read  pixels (cookies) back out  ● Storing cookies in web history  ● Storing cookies in HTTP ETags  ● Storing cookies in web cache  ● Window.name caching  ● Internet Explorer userData storage  ● HTML5 session web storage  ● HTML5 local web storage  ● HTML5 global storage  ● HTML5 web SQL database via SQLite  ● HTML5 IndexedDB  ● Java JNLP PersistenceService  ● Java CVE-2013-0422 exploit (applet sandbox escaping)  Because evercookies are much harder to delete than regular HTTP cookies, they raise a number of privacy  concerns.

1894,211,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Mobile Apps (In-App)  Identifying users in mobile apps (aka in-app) can consist of the following methods:  Cookies  To display online content inside web apps, some app developers use a piece of technology called webview. Webview can create cookies and store them inside a secure location on the device, which is known as a  sandbox or sandboxed environment. The main issue for AdTech is that these cookies are app-specific, meaning they can’t be shared across  different apps, therefore AdTech companies can’t identify the same user across different apps even though  they are using the same device. Advertising IDs  Mobile devices include an advertising ID:  ● Google’s Android ID (AID)  ● Apple’s ID for Advertising (IDFA)  ● Microsoft’s Advertising ID (aka Advertising Identifier)  These IDs are more persistent than web cookies, and even though users can’t disable or remove these IDs like  they can with cookies, they can easily reset them. 211",949,162,237.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

User Profile Matching  As we’ve just covered, identifying users via one method can be incredibly difficult and inaccurate. The problem is exacerbated when users use more than one device, which is often the case nowadays.",602,93,150.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1899,213,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Currently, there is no method that allows AdTech vendors to identify users as they move from one device to  another. The reason for this is because the traditional ways of identifying and tracking users with cookies in web  browsers wasn’t designed for the multi-device world. There are, however, two ways you can identify and track the same user as they move across different devices  with reasonable accuracy: deterministic matching and probabilistic matching . Deterministic and Probabilistic Matching  Deterministic and probabilistic matching are processes used to identify users across different devices. Companies will often use both deterministic and probabilistic matching together to increase match rates.",714,108,178.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1900,213,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:What Is Deterministic Matching? Deterministic matching involves creating a profile of users consisting of different pieces of data about them. These profiles are then used to identify users on different devices by looking for a common identifier. Common identifiers can include:  ● Email address  ● First and last name (if uncommon)  ● Address  ● Date of birth  ● Phone numbers  It’s important to note that this information would be hashed when it’s collected to remove personally identifiable  information. 213,511,86,127.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1901,214,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How Does Deterministic Matching Work? The most common way to deterministically match users in online advertising and marketing is by using an  email address as the common identifier, as this is unique to the user and is often available in different data  sets. Companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and LinkedIn are able to deterministically match users with ease  and accuracy because they require users to create accounts and sign in using an email address to access  their applications and sites on different devices. How deterministic matching works. .",559,92,139.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1902,214,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main advantage of deterministic matching is accuracy. It’s much more accurate than probabilistic  matching; most deterministic matching rates are around 80-90%. The main drawback, however, is that it lacks scale, as most companies don’t collect this type of data and email  addresses aren’t typically used for buying and selling online advertising. To address the issue of scale, publishers are requiring users to create an account or subscribe using their  email address to access certain content. The two main ways they can do this are:  By way of encouragement: Publishers can encourage visitors to provide an email address in exchange for  more access and content.",672,110,168.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1903,215,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:By way of force: Publishers can gate their content and restrict access to it unless users subscribe or create  an account. These tactics would work well with large publishers like news sites, as they typically have an engaged  audience that regularly visits their sites compared to small- and medium-sized publishers, as not everyone will  want to create an account just to read a few blog posts. What Is Probabilistic Matching? Unlike deterministic matching that uses a common identifier, such as an email, to match users to devices and  applications, probabilistic matching uses various pieces of data, algorithms, and statistical modeling to make a  match. The type of data used for probabilistic matching includes:  ● IP address  ● Location  ● Interests, behavior, and browsing history  ● Wi-fi networks  The image below illustrates how one user operating all three devices can be probabilistically matched to all of  them based on their IP address, location, interests and Wi-fi network.",992,167,248.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1904,216,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Although probabilistic matching isn’t as accurate as deterministic matching, it often uses deterministic data sets  to train the algorithms and increase accuracy. This process involves exposing the algorithms to a small group of deterministic and probabilistic data sets (a  couple hundred thousand) and training them to make connections (identify the same user). Then, the algorithms are applied to hundreds of thousands or even millions of data sets that don’t contain  deterministic matching. Even though probabilistic matching lacks the accuracy of deterministic matching, the main benefit is that it  offers better scale and reach. However, There are a few downsides to probabilistic matching, including:  ● Lack of transparency of the matching methods and accuracy.",771,118,192.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1905,216,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Redundant and outdated data. ● Decline in the availability of the data due to data-protection and privacy laws, such as the GDPR,  requiring consent to collect IP addresses, location and other data ( more on this below ). What Are Deterministic and Probabilistic Matching Used For? Because deterministic and probabilistic matching aim to identify users across different devices and apps, their  main use cases are cross-device targeting and cross-device attribution . Cross-device targeting: Identifying users across different devices and showing ads based on their behavior  on different devices – e.g. which websites they visit and what products they purchase.",664,103,166.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1906,216,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, a user might view a jacket on a laptop and then see the same jacket or similar product in an ad  on their smartphone. Cross-device attribution: Similar to cross-device targeting, this focuses on attributing impressions and clicks  to conversions and purchases made on different devices. For example, if a user clicked on an ad for running shoes on their smartphone, but purchased them on their  laptop, cross-device attribution would be able to attribute the ad click on the smartphone with the purchase on  the laptop. The Main Challenges With Identifying Users on Web Browser and Mobile  Apps  As we’ve mentioned throughout this chapter, AdTech companies face a number of challenges with identifying  users across web browsers and mobile apps.

They  manage the cookie-syncing and ID-matching processes on behalf of different AdTech platforms, so instead of  DSPs and SSPs having to sync cookies between themselves, they could centralize the process via an ID  solution. Step-by-step explanation:  1. The browser sends an ad request to a DMP with the cookie ID of the user.",467,82,116.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1914,220,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Step 1. Data collection: A company would send its customer IDs (i.e. first-party IDs) to the ID graph. These  first-party IDs could be taken from websites, mobile apps, and customer and data platforms (e.g. CRMs, CDPs,  and DMPs). Step 2. Match the customer IDs with the IDs in the graph: The company’s first-party IDs would then be  matched with all the other IDs in the graph, which would be done using a combination of deterministic and  probabilistic matching.",464,82,116.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1915,220,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Step 3. Activate the data for cross-device activities: The company can now identify their customers across  different devices and channels and run various cross-device activities, like ad targeting, personalization, and  attribution. 220",237,34,59.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1916,221,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Challenges Facing These ID Solutions  Apart from the fact that some of the solutions don’t scale in the same way as they once did (i.e. IDs created  from hashed email addresses aren’t as readily available as IDs stored in third-party cookies), all these identity  solutions face the same challenges — they still revolve around identification and rely on some type of ID. The reason this is a problem is because walled gardens like Google and Apple are constantly strengthening  their products to make them more privacy friendly. We’ve seen this with Apple’s ITP and changes to IDFA, and even Google has made changes to how Chrome  handles third-party cookies and is also planning on phasing them out in the near future (possibly by 2022). AdTech companies are moving from one identification method to another, and it won’t be long until Apple  and/or Google make some change to their web browsers or mobile operating systems to prevent these  identification methods. For this reason, many folks in the industry believe that these ID solutions are rather short-term solutions.",1079,184,269.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1917,221,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Many  say that the future of digital advertising and marketing won’t be done on an individual basis, but rather done in  a privacy friendly way where individuals are not identified. It’s too early to say if and when identification will disappear completely, so in the meantime, companies need to  use an identity solution like the ones listed above to ensure they can still run effective advertising and  marketing campaigns. The Future of User Identification in Web Browsers and Mobile Apps  The end of third-party cookies in web browsers means that companies will need to change the way they  identify users to continue powering key AdTech processes, such as behavioral targeting and measurement. Several possible solutions have been proposed, including using email addresses as an ID and utilizing local  storage, but many are limited to one domain and therefore won't be useful for cross-site identification. At the moment, there's no clear alternative to third-party cookies or standards that can be applied by all  companies in the digital advertising ecosystem.",1068,176,267.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Data Management Platforms (DMPs) & Data Usage  So far in this book we’ve looked at the role advertising technology platforms play in creating, running, and  optimizing digital ad campaigns. Now we’ll look at one of the most important elements that ties these two areas together: Data. Data is the fuel that powers AdTech platforms and campaigns. Specifically, data in digital advertising can be used for:  ● Identification  ● Targeting  ● Reporting  222",457,79,114.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1920,223,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Attribution  ● Campaign optimizations  Thanks to the rise of the Internet, advertisers and publishers now have access to enormous amounts of quality  and generalized data sets that could never have been generated in the offline world. These data sets can give  companies deeper insights into consumer behavior, identify trends, and improve campaign performance. In this chapter, we’ll look at how companies collect data, the different types of data, the role of data platforms  like data management platforms (DMP) and customer data platforms (CDPs), and what data is used for. The Different Types Of Data: First-Party, Second-Party, And Third-Party  Data  Not all data is the same, and each piece plays a different role for both advertisers and publishers. First-Party Data  First-party data is considered the most valuable type of data for both advertisers and publishers because it is  collected directly from people who have interacted with the brand, such as customers.",976,160,244.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1921,223,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:First-party data is collected by a website or mobile app directly from the visitor/user. First-party data is often collected by:  ● Ecommerce and offline transactions: Data about which products people have purchased and the  value of orders, as well as personal information such as names, postal and billing addresses, email  addresses, and phone numbers. ● Customer relationship management (CRM) systems: Data about people who have created an  account with your business, downloaded a digital product (e.g. ebook), and purchased something from  you. Just like with ecommerce data, this often includes names, addresses, phone numbers, and email  addresses. ● Website and mobile app analytics: Data about which pages the user has browsed, videos they’ve  watched, and other content interactions.",794,125,198.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1922,224,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:First-party data can come from online and offline sources (see the section below for more details). Brands and advertisers use this type of data to convert visitors into customers and upsell products and  services to existing customers. Second-Party Data  Second-party data is sometimes referred to as partner data, as it is first-party information collected by one  company and sold or traded to another. Second-party data is collected through data partnerships. A typical partnership involves two non-competing companies with similar audiences.",546,83,136.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1923,224,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, a hotel chain could partner with an airline and buy or trade the airline’s first-party data. The hotel  chain could use the airline’s data to run targeted ad campaigns and display ads promoting their hotels to the  airline’s customers. This partnership would benefit the hotel chain, as accommodation is often something people search for when  booking flights. The partnership could be one-way (i.e. the hotel chain buys the airline’s first-party data), or the hotel chain and  airline could set up a data-trade deal where they share information with each other. This would allow the airline to display ads and messages to the hotel chain’s customers as well.",672,113,168.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1924,224,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:As the airline collects a lot of value first-party data, they could partner with many other types of companies,  such as with exclusive brands that could target the airline’s high-income customers with luxury products like  watches and jewelry.

Based on these data sets, data brokers can create inferred data points about interests, purchase preferences,  income groups, demographics and more. The data can be further enriched from offline data providers, such as credit card companies, credit scoring  agencies and telcos. From there, data brokers and DMP vendors can create audience segments.",721,113,180.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1928,226,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:★★☆  Second-party data from  one partner quite often  contains audiences that  share similar  characteristics to the  second partner’s target  audience. For example, an audience  created by a luxury hotel  would also match the target  audience of a luxury watch  brand. Given the direct  relationship, it is usually  fully transparent where the  data comes from and how  it was collected. ★☆☆  Because third-party data is  collected and aggregated from  different sources, the direct  connection between an  advertiser and user is lost.

Second-party data can be  shared exclusively,  meaning it can be used as  a competitive advantage  over other companies  offering the same products  or services.

Combining Online and Offline Data Together  Companies that collect both online and offline data would combine them together to get a clearer picture of  their customers and audience. For large companies, such as retailers, integrating their offline and online records is not an easy task, but once  it’s done, it can prove valuable as it provides several business advantages.

Data Onboarding With Google AdWords and Facebook Ads  Due to the vast amounts of data that is being onboarded via companies like LiveRamp, the process can be  quite complex and take a number of days to complete. Other companies, like Google and Facebook allow advertisers to upload simpler offline and online data sets  (typically just an email address) to their platforms and use it for targeting and retargeting. Although this method  doesn’t offer the same scale as data onboarding via the companies above, it’s often a suitable option for small-  and medium-sized companies. 236",623,104,155.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

It represents a user and may contain the  following pieces of information:  ● profile id  ● cookie id (list)  ● hashed email (list)  ● sid / uuid (list)  ● country (last seen)  ● name ( nullable )  ● device_type (last seen)  ● device_vendor (last seen)  ● device_os (last seen)  ● browser_vendor (last seen)  ● gender (nullable)  ● company (nullable)  ● company size (nullable)  ● matching ids (list)  In some cases, a profile will be created containing only a few pieces of data (e.g. cookie id, device_type, and  device_os) and will be extended when more data becomes available — i.e. profile building . When a DMP receives new events containing a known piece of data (i.e. one that is in the DMP), then it is  added to the relevant profile. On the other hand, if an input event contains a new piece of data (i.e. one that isn’t in the DMP), then a new  profile is created.",1257,248,314.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1957,238,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:It’s quite often the case that two profiles contain the same pieces of data (e.g. cookie id). If this occurs, the DMP will have to perform an operation known as profile merging . 238",182,34,45.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1958,239,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The image above illustrates how profiles and audiences are built in a DMP. The goal of profile merging is to ensure that no profiles contain duplicate pieces of data and that no two profiles  contain the same unique identifiers (e.g. cookie IDs and email addresses).

1959,240,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:All three events come from the same user, but this isn’t known until the third event arrives in the DMP, meaning  all three events would be treated as separate profiles. For this example, all three profiles would be merged together into one profile. Most DMPs would use a master ID — a single ID associated with one profile — to ensure accurate profile  merging. Most often this would be a persistent ID, such as an email address. When new events containing the master ID enter the DMP, all other data associated with the event will be  added to that profile.",559,103,139.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1960,240,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:How to Merge Profiles Together  There are a few ways a DMP can merge profiles together. Below we’ll list some of the main ways. Overwrite existing IDs and attributes: This is one of the simplest ways to merge profiles as it simply  replaces existing IDs with new ones as they enter the DMP. 240,294,56,73.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1961,241,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Alphabetical sorting: This method sorts the values alphabetically and then uses the first value. For example,  if there were 2 profiles with the names “Robert” and “Bob”, then “Bob” would be used as the name value  because the letter “B” comes before “R”. Timestamp sorting: With this method, the value that has the first or last recorded timestamp would be used. In most cases, timestamp sorting will be the most desired method to use. Wait-and-see sorting: A more complex approach would be to keep all values for reference until a different  sorting method (e.g. timestamp) becomes available.",594,100,148.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1962,241,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Then you’d be able to see whether the assumption was  correct and decide on the final values after the merging operation has finished. Data Storage  Although the concept of storing data in a DMP seems rather simple, the actual technical implementation can  be challenging due to the large amount of data being stored, as well as the need to move it to other areas and  prevent data loss. Data Taxonomies  Taxonomy in a DMP refers to the naming convention used for various pieces of data. For example, instead of having two taxonomies like “user” and “visitor”, you could create or define one  taxonomy (e.g. “user”) that represents both terms. Below is an example of how an ecommerce store could structure its taxonomies:  241",726,130,181.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1963,243,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Audience Segmentation and Creation  Audience segmentation involves placing users into groups based on common characteristics, such as age,  location, behavior, interests, and many others. These segments form the basis for data activation, whereby these segments are used for a number of different  purposes, such as for ad targeting and analytics. See the Use Cases Of Data Activation With A Data Management Platform (DMP) section below for more  details. How A DMP Creates Audience Segments  To create audience segments, a DMP uses a series of conditions to filter the data and produce specific groups  of users. The conditions may include general information such as:  ● Country, region, or city  ● Device type  ● Operating system  ● Referral URL  And may also include more specific data about users’ behavior like:  ● Events (button clicks, page-views, etc.)",861,146,215.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1965,244,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here’s an example of what that might look like:  An example of how a DMP creates audience segments. Apart from selecting which users to include in an audience segment, you can also add filters to exclude users  from the segment and set the recency and frequency of certain actions. For example, you could add users who have viewed your website at least 5 times (frequency) in the past 30  days (recency). These two additional factors will go a long way towards defining your audience segments and their usefulness  and can significantly impact the relevance and scope of the segments. Relevance : Increasing the time frame for data points to be included.",654,115,163.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1966,244,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For instance, setting a time frame of  “greater than 30 days” can add users who may be less likely to convert. However, raising the frequency to “at  least 3 times” for certain event information can mean adding a user who is highly engaged and likely to  convert. Scope : Similarly, extending the time frame and reducing the frequency will broaden the scope of the audience,  which would be useful for brand awareness but not for increasing conversions. Once you’ve created audience segments, you can now activate your data . 244",529,94,132.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1967,245,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Use Cases Of Data Activation With A Data Management Platform (DMP)  Data activation in a DMP is using audience segments for a range of different activities. It’s often considered the  most important function of a DMP. Below are the most common ways advertisers and publishers can activate their data and audience segments  in their DMP. Data Activation for Advertisers  Media Buying And Optimization  For advertisers and marketers, activating their data for digital media buying is one of the main use cases. The main way to activate data for media buying is via cookie syncing .",579,100,144.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1968,245,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:We covered cookie syncing in a previous chapter: 10. User Identification  First, the advertiser would start by integrating their DSP with a DMP. From there, the advertiser can create  audiences and sync their cookies with the DMP’s cookies so they can identify their audience across multiple  publishers. When an advertiser (via a DSP) identifies a user who belongs to one of their audiences, they can show them  an ad that is more personalized and relevant. Because this form of targeting is more dynamic than traditional  targeting (e.g. showing iphone users the same ad), it often produces more clicks and conversions.",621,105,155.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1969,246,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:It’s important to note here that the DMP could either have its pixel on the publisher’s website, or it could  receive it from the SSP via piggybacking, or both. Brands and advertisers can also use a DMP to improve retargeting and dynamic creative optimization. Another key part of activating data in a DMP for media buying is improving campaign performance and  reducing ad waste. DMPs can provide advertisers with detailed reports, allowing them to see the best and worst performing  audiences, and make real-time optimizations to increase reach, performance, and optimize media spend. Look-alike Modeling  Advertisers can use a DMP to perform lookalike modeling — a process that finds people that have similar  characteristics to an advertiser’s target audience.",764,124,191.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1970,246,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For example, an ecommerce store selling motorsport gear wanting to increase its audience could perform  lookalike modeling to find new people who were interested in motorsports but hadn’t visited their store. They  could define a set of criteria that matched their existing audience, such as location and interests, and then use  a DMP to create those new audiences. 246",370,62,92.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1971,247,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ecommerce store could also place a pixel from a DMP on their purchase confirmation page to collect data  about customer behavior across different websites. The DMP could analyze this data and look for similarities in  behavior among the store’s existing customers. These similarities can then be used as the basis for creating  new audiences. How Does Look-alike Modeling Work? Lookalike modeling analyzes data and uses algorithms to identify common characteristics and similarities in  behavior.,500,79,125.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1972,247,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because the main goal of lookalike modeling is to find new audiences, it works best when it’s able to analyze  data outside of an advertiser’s own database. For this reason, most lookalike modeling is done by DMPs that  have collected large amounts of data from multiple sources. To create a look-alike model, advertisers need to define the attributes and behaviors of their most valuable  customers. The stricter the look-alike model is (i.e. the more attributes), the better chance advertisers have of finding more  people who match their target audience. This will improve the advertiser’s chances of receiving more  conversions.",632,104,158.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1973,247,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, advertisers could be less strict with the look-alike model by defining fewer attributes and behaviors if  their goal is to focus on reach and awareness rather than higher conversion rates. Below is an example of a look-alike model that has tightly defined (more) attributes and behaviors, and one  that has loosely defined (less) attributes and behaviors. 247",368,60,92.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1974,248,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:What Can Look-alike Modeling Be Used For? The main use case of look-alike modeling is prospecting, which involves finding new potential customers  and/or visitors. However, it can also extend the reach of online advertising campaigns. Let’s say you target audiences based on a set of attributes, such as age, gender and location. By applying look-alike modeling to your campaigns, you can find similar customers who perhaps aren’t  included in your current audiences because you don’t have enough data (e.g. we lack the attributes needed to  make a match) or they don’t fit your current audiences (i.e. they consist of other attributes) but are still similar  to your best customers.",683,113,170.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1975,248,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Audience intelligence  Advertisers can enrich visitor and customer data by matching and comparing their current audiences against  third-party data sets and adding information about both customers and prospects, including their  demographics, interests, income or purchase preferences, to their database. 248",308,43,77.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1976,249,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This allows them to learn more about how people behave, fine tune their target audience, and identify what  makes them convert. Brands and advertisers can use audience intelligence to optimize and personalize certain areas of their site  and campaigns to improve engagement and increase conversions. For example, a travel website that promotes thousands of different hotels and resorts may identify a group of  visitors who are less price sensitive, but require more flexibility and display more expensive offers with a free  cancellation option to them. Data Activation For Publishers  So far, we’ve explained the ways in which advertisers can use a DMP for data activation, so now it’s time to  have a look at how publishers can utilize a DMP.

1977,249,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:From there,  they can be used for a number of different use cases. Here are the main ways publishers can activate their data. Increase the Value of Their Inventory  Due to the large volume of user data that many medium- and large-size publishers collect, they can increase  the value of their inventory by creating audiences and then offering them to advertisers. The reason this benefits publishers is because advertisers will pay a higher price (e.g. CPM or CPC rate) if  they know that their ad will be seen by the right target group and highly engaged users. How are publishers able to pass these audience segments to advertisers?",634,112,158.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1978,249,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There are a few ways publishers can make their audience segments available to advertisers and increase their  ad revenue:  1. Cookie syncing: A publisher’s SSP could sync cookies with a DMP or DSP to allow advertisers to bid  on impressions that will be shown to a user in their target audience. 2. Deal IDs in PMP deals: Private marketplace deals allow publishers to offer their most prized inventory  to a select group of advertisers. By broadcasting their audience segments in PMP deals, publishers can  earn even more money on their premium inventory.",555,97,138.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

1980,251,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Content personalization on a site that does use a DMP. Audience Extension For Publishers  Publishers can use a DMP to create audience segments, which can be used for audience extension. Audience extension involves a publisher creating audiences from their first-party data, which includes  contextual and behavioral data like age, location, interests, web history, purchase history, click-based  interactions, etc. Publishers can then push these audiences to AdTech platforms, allowing advertisers to target these audiences  across the Internet — not just target them on the publisher’s websites. 251",600,90,150.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1981,252,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here’s an overview of how audience extension works:  1. The publisher’s DMP collects its first-party data and creates audience segments. 2. The DMP passes on the publisher’s audience segments to advertisers via DSPs. This is done via  cookie syncing.,250,41,62.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1982,252,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:3. If an advertiser’s DSP identifies a publisher’s audience during an RTB auction originating from a  different website, then it bids on that impression. 4. If the DSP wins, the ad is displayed to the publisher’s audience but on a different site. Audience extension is a win-win for publishers and advertisers — it allows publishers to create a new revenue  stream and advertisers to find their target audiences across more websites.",433,73,108.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1983,252,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Data Partnership  The publisher can set up a direct and exclusive partnership with another website, for example, a site that wants  to run ad campaigns targeted at people living in the New York area that listen to the music online.

Selling Their Data  The publisher could also just sell the segments or anonymized user profiles to data companies (e.g. data  brokers and DMPs). The data broker could either use the segments created by the publisher or group the anonymized user profiles  into demographic segments based on different characteristics, such as location, age, interests, etc. The data broker would then resell the data to advertisers who want to direct their campaigns to a specific  demographic group. The data in these user segments would now be classified as third-party data.",618,100,154.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1985,254,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Publishers can monetize their data via a data broker. Compared to the partnership option, this monetization process is much less transparent. The publisher also  loses its independence, as it is the data broker who decides which segments of data are shared and what  kinds of segments are created from the publisher’s visitors. Data Brokers and Integrations With Programmatic Media-Buying Platforms  While all companies that operate within the online advertising industry collect data, there are some companies  that make a business only out of collecting and selling online consumer data.

1988,256,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In the digital advertising and marketing industries, many DMPs act as data brokers and vice versa. The data  collection process is similar to that of DMPs (listed above). Data Pricing Models  Once DMPs and data brokers have collected the data, they usually sell it on to advertisers and AdTech  vendors via two pricing models: a fixed CPM or a percentage of the media cost. Fixed CPM Price  The most common way for DMPs and data brokers to sell data is on a cost per mille (cost per thousand) basis. This means they are paid a fixed amount, such as $1.25 for each 1,000 unique cookies created by their site(s).",610,113,152.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1989,256,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main advantage of this model is that it provides a guaranteed price for both the data provider and  advertiser/media buyer. However, it doesn’t take into account important variables, such as context or the real value of the ad  placement, meaning it places a fixed price on the audience which could actually be worth more than the CPM  price suggests. There are also issues surrounding the ROI of audience data sold on a fixed CPM price. Often, the CPM price of audience data is actually more than the CPM price of the impression itself. This means  that an advertiser could buy an impression on a CPM of $1.10 but the CPM of the audience data could be  $1.25, which adds significant cost and makes generating a reasonable ROI much harder to achieve.",754,137,188.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1990,256,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Percentage of the Media Cost  Many data brokers and advertisers/media buyers are moving towards a percentage of media cost pricing  model due to the very issues the fixed CPM pricing model presents. As the name suggests, data providers charge advertisers and media buyers a percentage of the media cost for  their audience data. So if the impression was sold at a CPM of $.50 and the data provider charged 20% of the media cost, then the  advertiser or media buyer would pay $.10 for the audience data. While it may appear that the data brokers is losing money via the % of media cost, they are actually making  third-party data more valuable and useful for advertisers and media buyers as they benefit from improved  targeting, optimized ROIs, and better campaign performance — all of which lead to high adoption rates of  third-party data, which spells good news for data brokers.

Some common problems with using third-party data in programmatic media buying:  Problem 1: The main issue with this method of selling through technology platforms is that it’s often hard to  know whether a DSP used a certain audience from a DMP. In the RTB auction model, data is usually provided in every bid request sent to the DSP. The bidder on DSP  side sends bids on behalf of the advertiser, but there is no way to tell if the bidder used the data during the  exchange. Problem 2: The other problem with this model is that the price of the data is usually static.",704,133,176.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1992,257,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The only difference is that some segments are considered premium or of higher value than others, and the  CPM price is then higher. There is no way to dynamically set the price for the data based on the demand  and/or quality, and therefore, all the parties in the ecosystem (e.g. publishers, data suppliers, data providers,  advertisers, etc.)may be losing out financially. The Future of DMPs  Because every digital advertising process is powered by data, DMPs have been a key component of a brand's,  agency’s, and publisher’s tech stack.

Google Chrome’s announcement that they’ll be shutting off support for third-party cookies by 2022 (rough  timeline), means that almost 100% of web browser traffic won’t support third-party cookies. To survive the next decade, most DMPs will need to look for ways to help publishers and advertisers identify  their audiences without the use of third-party cookies, for example, by using identity resolution services.

A customer data platform is a piece of software that collects data from different sources and creates a single  customer view of a customer, aka single customer view (SCV). Although DMPs and CDPs are fairly similar in the way they collect, normalize, enrich, and activate data, there  are a couple of main differences in the type of data they collect and how they use it.

A customer (aka user) journey is the path a person takes from the time they first become aware of a brand to  the time they complete a goal defined by an advertiser or marketer (e.g. a purchase or download). Although everyone will have a different customer journey, it’s useful for advertisers and marketers to  understand how the different stages of a customer journey and the interactions a person has influence their  decision to complete a goal. Each interaction a person has with a brand during their customer journey is known as a touchpoint. What is a touchpoint?",598,105,149.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
1999,261,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A touchpoint is an interaction a user has with your brand on different channels. But a user doesn’t have to actually interact with the touchpoint for it to count. For example, if a user sees a  display ad from a brand but doesn’t click on it, then it’s still classed as a touchpoint. Examples of touchpoints include:  ● Website visits  ● Product views  ● Reviews  ● Blog posts  ● Ebooks and whitepapers  ● Digital ads  ● Social media content  ● Videos  ● Emails  ● Store visits  In many cases, these touchpoints will influence a person’s perception about your brand. Advertisers and marketers will tailor the messaging across different touchpoints depending on where the  person is in the customer journey (e.g. awareness, consideration, and purchase).",752,137,188.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Online to Online Attribution Models  Online to online attribution identifies which touchpoints a user had before they completed a goal across  different online channels. As the goal of most online ad campaigns is to drive users to a website, advertisers and marketers view  attribution reports provided by web analytics tools, MarTech platforms like marketing automation platforms and  attribution software, and AdTech platforms like ad servers. There are two main types of online to online attribution — inter-channel and intra-channel . Inter-channel attribution looks at touchpoints across different channels.",666,101,166.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2002,262,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Intra-channel attribution looks at touchpoints in the same channel. How Does Online Attribution work? When it comes to detecting which online channels and interactions a user had in their customer journey, there  are a few ways you can do this. The simplest way is to use the Referrer field in the HTTP protocol when a user is directed from an online  channel to your website. 262",380,68,95.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2003,263,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Referrer field is passed with every request from the browser to the web server.

Web analytics tools, and AdTech and MarTech platforms will display the following referrers:  Direct  When a visit is marked as direct it means that the referrer information isn’t known. There are many reasons why a referrer can be marked as direct:  ● The user entered the URL in their brower’s web address bar or accessed it from their bookmarks. ● The user entered the website from a subdomain, e.g. they first accessed publisher1.com and then  clicked on a link that took them to blog.publisher1.com.",1077,178,269.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Social  Visits from social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube are marked as ‘social’.

Campaign  The ‘campaign’ referrer is recorded when the website a user lands on contains UTM parameters. In this case,  the Referrer field is ignored and the UTM parameters are used to determine the referrer.",598,105,149.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2006,264,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Some AdTech and MarTech platforms will just list this referrer as ‘Campaign’, while others will mark them as  ‘Paid social’ or ‘Paid search’, depending on what information is contained in the UTM parameters. For example, if a user clicks on a LinkedIn ad and is directed to a website containing the UTM parameters  below, then the referrer could either be recorded as ‘Campaign’ or ‘Paid social’. ?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=linkedin-ad  Similarly, if a user clicks on a paid search ad on Google and is directed to a website containing the below UTM  parameters, then the referrer could either be recorded as ‘Campaign’ or ‘Paid search’. ?",659,107,164.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Online Attribution Models  Now that we know how the different online channels are detected, we’ll now look at the different online  attribution models. 1. The Last Click Attribution Model  The last click (aka last interaction or last touchpoint ) attribution model is the oldest model out of them all  and despite the number of new attribution models, it is still the default model in many web analytics, MarTech,  and AdTech platforms. The last click attribution model assigns 100% of a conversion to the last known referral, click, or traffic source.",786,127,196.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2008,264,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:So if the last action before a conversion was a direct entry, then 100% of the conversion would be attributed to  the direct entry. 264",135,26,33.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2009,265,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Although this model is one of the simplest, it ignores all the other touchpoints in a customer journey, which can  lead to poor decision making when choosing which channels to optimize. 2. The Last Non-Direct Attribution Model  The last non-direct attribution model is very similar to the last click attribution model but it removes direct  visits from the equation. With this model, 100% of a conversion is attributed to the last known referral that wasn’ t a direct visit. Here’s an example of how this process looks:  1.",523,92,130.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2010,265,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A user clicks on a link on Facebook and is directed to your website. 2. They browse your website but then leave. 3. They later type your website into their address bar and download one of your ebooks.,200,38,50.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2011,265,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because the third step is a direct visit, the last non-direct attribution model would ignore this and assign 100%  of the conversion to Facebook. 265",149,26,37.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2012,266,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This model is better than the last click model, but still doesn’t take into account the other touchpoints a person  has in their customer journey and can also lead to bad decisions. 3. The First Click Attribution Model  The first click (aka first interaction or first touch ) attribution model is similar to the previous two, except it  assigns 100% of a conversion to the first click or referrer in the customer journey. This model suffers from the same drawbacks as last click and last non-direct attribution models. 266",522,92,130.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2013,267,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:4. The Linear Attribution Model  The linear attribution model evenly attributes conversions to all touchpoints in a customer journey. Even though this model values each conversion equally, which rarely is the case, it is useful for getting an  overview of the customer journey. 5. The Time Decay Attribution Model  The time decay attribution model is a modification of the linear model.",386,64,96.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2014,267,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:With this attribution model, the touchpoint that is closest in time to the conversion gets the most credit. The remaining touchpoints are given credit based on how far away they are from the conversion. Put simply,  the further away a touchpoint is from a conversion, the more its credit “decays”. It not only provides the full picture of the customer journey but also assigns a certain weight to each touchpoint  based on the time difference between each touchpoint. 267",471,81,117.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2015,268,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The above image illustrates how the different touchpoint could be attributed for the conversion. This model assumes that the most recent touchpoints were the ones that influenced the user to convert, which  may or may not be the case. 6. The Position Based Attribution Model  The position based attribution model grabs all the touchpoints in the customer journey and assigns them  credit based on their position in the conversion path. This model gives more weight to the first and last interaction in the customer journey.",523,88,130.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2016,269,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This model is often a good choice for advertisers as it provides an overview of the customer journey and  assigns credit to the two most important interactions — the first and last interactions. 7. The Custom Attribution Model  Some AdTech and MarTech platforms allow you to create custom attribution models whereby advertisers set  their own rules for attributing touchpoints in a customer journey. This option is often a good choice for advertisers as they can take into consideration the specifics of their  campaigns, their customers, and customer journey. The above online attribution models are specific to one device (e.g. a laptop and smartphone) and web  browser (e.g. Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome).",714,117,178.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2017,269,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If we want to attribute conversions from different devices  and web browsers, then we’ll have to use cross-device attribution. Cross-Device Attribution  Cross-device attribution aims to record interactions a user has with a brand across multiple touchpoints and  devices, and ultimately attribute conversions accordingly. Where online attribution models aim to attribute  conversions across different channels, multi-touch attribution aims to attribute conversions across different web  browsers and devices, as well as channels. Here’s an example of how cross-device attribution would look:  How Does Cross-Device Attribution Work? To attribute online conversions between different channels, AdTech and MarTech companies use cookies —  typically third-party cookies.",767,108,191.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2018,270,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, because cookies are tied to one device and one web browser, they can’t be exported to another,  meaning they are useless for cross-device attribution. To attribute conversions across different web browsers and devices, measurement companies use  deterministic matching, probabilistic matching, or a combination of both. We explained what these two methods are and how they work in a previous chapter (10. User Identification),  but here’s a recap:  Deterministic matching uses common identifiers, such as email addresses and phone numbers, to identify  and match users across different devices. Probabilistic matching uses less-common pieces of data, such as IP addresses and location data, to identify  and match users across devices.",744,115,186.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2019,270,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because the data isn’t as accurate or unique as deterministic data,  probabilistic matching also uses algorithms and statistical modeling to make a match. To use these methods for cross-device attribution, AdTech and MarTech companies would create user profiles  that collect and contain these pieces of data. Below are two examples of how deterministic matching and probabilistic matching can be used for  cross-device attribution:  Deterministic matching for cross-device attribution  270",490,74,122.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2020,271,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Probabilistic matching for cross-device attribution:  As we can see in the examples above, the actual attribution process is similar for both deterministic and  probabilistic matching. The main difference is the data that is used to identify the user and attribute the  conversion. For walled gardens like Google and Facebook, attributing conversions with deterministic matching is much  easier than for independent AdTech companies because of the types of data they collect — e.g. email  addresses and names — and because many users will use their Facebook or Google account across different  devices. If brands, agencies, and independent AdTech companies (e.g. DSPs) want to conduct cross-device attribution,  then they’ll need to use a DMP like LiveRamp or a cross-device measure platform like Tapad . These companies will collect user data from different online and offline sources, create user profiles, and  produce a graph — sometimes referred to as an identity, ID, or device graph.",990,160,247.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Offline-Online Attribution  Even though advertising and marketing is moving online, there is still a need to combine the offline data with  online data and attribute and track users across offline and online sources. For example, it’s important for advertisers to know whether a billboard ad resulted in a website visit or online  conversion.",484,80,121.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2022,272,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Examples of offline channels include:  ● Direct mail  ● Traditional outdoor advertising — i.e. out-of-home (OOH) and digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising. ● Telemarketing  272,177,27,44.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2023,273,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● TV  ● Radio  Below are the most common ways for advertisers to attribute offline ad exposure with online conversions. Vanity URLs  Vanity URLs are domain names that are often created for a specific advertising campaign. They’re designed to  match the company’s brand, be easy to remember, and shorter than the actual URL of the landing page. Companies use vanity URLs to promote a new product or service and use them in OOH, TV, and radio ads. For example, instead of using a URL like  company1.com/new-product?utm_source=ooh&utm_medium=billboard-airport&utm_campaign=new-product ,  an advertiser could use newproduct.com .",625,99,156.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2024,273,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The vanity URL could take the user to a dedicated landing page, (e.g. newproduct.com) or redirect them to a  different landing page (e.g. company1.com/new-product). With either option, the vanity URL will redirect the  user to a destination page and add campaign tracking parameters for traffic attribution. There are different types of vanity URL:  1. Standalone vanity URLs, e.g. newproduct.com  2. Subpage vanity URLs, e.g. company1.com/newproduct  3.",454,71,113.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2025,273,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Shortened vanity URLs, e.g. sv.ly/newproduct  Vanity URLs are useful for measuring the reach and impact of offline ad campaigns and attributing them to  online website visits and conversions, but they are not 100% accurate because some users who saw the ad  may later perform a Google search for the product or service instead of typing in the vanity URL. This means  any conversion that occurs as a result of this will be attributed to Google Search and not the offline ad. However, it’s still a valuable method for gauging the effectiveness of an offline ad. Time-limited attribution windows  Another way to measure offline ad exposure to online web traffic and conversions is via the time-limited  attribution window. This model analyzes a period of time (e.g. 30 minutes) after the air time of a TV or radio advertisement and  looks for increases in web traffic and conversions.",882,153,220.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2026,273,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:When applying this model, advertisers need to consider the following:  ● How long should the window be open?E.g. should we look at web traffic and conversions 30 minutes  after our radio ad aired or longer? ● How can we separate the traffic and conversions that were exposed to the campaign from the ones that  weren’t? ● How do we determine whether other campaigns influenced the increase in traffic and conversions  during the attribution window? 273",452,79,113.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2027,274,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Most AdTech and MarTech companies offer an attribution window model as part of their measurement offering,  but it’s often limited to one channel (e.g. display). If advertisers want to measure offline ad exposure to online  web traffic and conversions, then advertisers will need to set this up manually in their analytics software or use  a dedicated attribution tool. Online surveys  Instead of using complex attribution models, advertisers could simply ask users how they found their website. Although this is a very simple approach, it can provide valuable insights that you might not get with attribution  models. Advertisers can implement online surveys at three different levels:  ● When a user fills out the purchase or sign-up form or on the confirmation page.",769,127,192.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2028,274,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● When a user is browsing your website, open a discreet sidebar pop-up asking them to fill out a survey  (you could offer a coupon code as an incentive). ● When the user is leaving the website, open a pop-up survey. Even though not every user will fill out a survey or just select a random field, advertisers will still have enough  data to compare the survey results with their attribution and traffic source data. 274",419,78,104.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2029,275,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Coupons  Coupons have been around for decades but their popularity and effectiveness for attributing conversions is still  strong. By using coupons in their marketing materials, advertisers can attribute conversions to specific offline  channels, often with more accuracy than with attribution models and technology platforms. Coupons work best with direct mail campaigns and other printed advertising materials, but it’s a good idea to  issue unique coupons per campaign, and when possible, per client. Zip/Postal codes  Collecting zip codes from online customers can be used to measure different offline campaigns, such as direct  mail and out-of-home campaigns. Although this method won’t be very accurate — you won’t know for certain whether someone with a certain zip  code was influenced by your campaign — it can be used in conjunction with the models listed above for  improved accuracy.",895,143,223.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2030,275,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This approach would really only make sense for ecommerce stores, or companies that have an offline and  online store, as they collect billing and delivery information during the purchase process. Online-Offline Attribution  Let’s now look at a few ways advertisers can attribute online activity, such as ad views and clicks, to offline  purchases in a store. Beacons  Beacons are bluetooth-enabled devices that can transmit signals to and from mobile devices such as  smartphones and tablets. When placed in brick-and-mortar stores, they can be used to send push notifications to devices in a certain  radius and collect data about the device itself. The latter can help attribute online activity, such as ad clicks and  mobile app activity, to offline purchases.",763,126,190.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2031,275,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Zip/postal codes at POS  You read a moment ago about how advertisers can use zip codes to attribute offline ads to online conversions,  but they can also be used in reverse. One of the most common ways to collect zip codes from customers is by asking for them at point of sale  (POS). Advertisers could then match the zip codes in store with the location data in the online ad campaign reports. Similarly with the use of zip codes for offline and online attribution, this approach is not very accurate and is  best used as an addition to other attribution methods. 275",568,106,142.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

There are many types of ad fraud, but they all  work by misrepresenting advertising metrics, such as impressions, clicks, and conversions for monetary gain.",602,98,150.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2036,279,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Cost of Ad Fraud  Numerous studies show that ad fraud costs the digital advertising industry between US $26 billion and US $42  billion a year. To put that into perspective, global digital ad spend in 2019 was estimated to be US $333.25  billion . Below are some figures from recent studies into the cost of ad fraud. $26 billion : CHEQ, an ad fraud solution, found that ad fraud could cost the online advertising industry US $26  billion in 2020. $42 billion to $100 billion: Juniper networks estimates that ad fraud cost advertisers US $42 billion in 2019,  with this number rising to US $100 billion by 2023.",615,114,153.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2037,279,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:10% to 30% : The World Federation of Advertisers estimates that 10% to 30% of advertising is not seen by  consumers because of ad fraud and problems with ad viewability. Determining the true cost and scale of ad fraud is difficult because:  1. It can be very hard to detect fraudulent activity due to the sophistication of the ad fraud techniques. 2. The technology to protect advertisers is constantly stuck in a game of cat and mouse with fraudsters.,452,81,113.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2038,279,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:3. Most ad fraud goes undetected and many companies choose not to publicly disclose the fact that  they’ve been impacted by it. All these factors mean that the actual impact of ad fraud may be higher than what is reported. There are a number of reasons why this figure is so huge:  1. Fraudsters follow the money .,314,60,78.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2039,279,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad fraud moves from one lucrative area to another. The increase in ad  spend has attracted more fraudulent behavior. You’ll often see an increase in ad fraud in emerging  areas of digital advertising, such as mobile in-app and OTT/CTV (more on this below). 2. Digital advertising is less regulated than the financial industries , meaning it’s easier for fraudsters  to get away with their criminal activities.",409,69,102.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2040,279,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:3. The digital advertising ecosystem is fragmented and complex , which makes it easier for fraudsters  to conceal their activity. The Main Types of Ad Fraud  What makes online ad fraud so challenging is that there are several ways to steal money from advertisers and  publishers, with new ad fraud methods being created all the time. The most common ad fraud techniques include:  Invisible and Hidden Ads  With this ad fraud technique, ads will be invisible or hidden on websites, but an impression will still be  recorded. 279",527,94,131.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2041,280,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:There a few ways fraudsters can carry out this technique:  ● Display an ad in a 1×1 pixel iframe. ● Display ads outside of the viewport area. ● Display (multiple) re-sized ads. ● Display several ads in an iframe loaded to a single ad slot so that out of all the ads loaded, only one will  actually be visible to the user. This is also known as ad stacking.",356,71,89.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2042,280,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This technique is not the same as non-viewable impressions (see below) whereby ads are displayed on a  website and recorded but aren’t seen by a user because they’re at the bottom of the page where the user  doesn’t scroll to. Domain Spoofing  Domain spoofing involves a fraudulent website disguising itself as a genuine and often premium website. Some fraudulent AdTech platforms can also carry out domain spoofing. Brands pay high CPMs to display their ads on premium websites or websites where their target audience is, so  by disguising itself as one of these websites, fraudsters can take the ad revenue that should have gone to the  real website. Ad Injection  Also known as hijacked ads, this type of ad fraud injects ads into unsuspecting websites, usually via malicious  browser plugins or mobile apps.",811,140,202.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2043,280,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad injection can be done in a few ways:  ● Compromising the user’s computer to change the DNS resolver — e.g. by resolving the  ad.doubleclick.com domain to the IP of the server controlled by the attacker and therefore serving  different ads. ● Compromising the publisher’s website or the user’s computer to change the HTML content on the fly —  e.g. changing ad tags placed by the publisher to tags controlled by the attacker. ● Compromising the user’s proxy server or router (or the ISP’s router) to spoof the DNS server or change  the HTML content of the site on the fly. Click Injection  Click injection, also known as hijacked clicks, is a similar technique to ad injection, but instead of injecting ads  into a web page, fraudsters will inject clicks. The way fraudsters make money is by receiving money for the  click and also the conversion.",849,154,212.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2044,280,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:So instead of the commission for a conversion going to a genuine publisher or mobile app, it would go to the  fraudster as their fake click would be recorded as the last touch before the conversion. Cookie Stuffing  The cookie-stuffing technique is used to steal money from CPA or affiliate marketing campaigns. 280",315,55,78.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2045,281,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because cookies are often used to attribute conversions, fraudsters will stuff a user’s browser with cookies  they’ve either created themselves or have stolen from other publishers. This allows them to receive  commissions from affiliate networks when a user completes a conversion on a publisher’s websites (e.g.  purchases a product). How Ad Fraud Is Carried Out  The above types of ad fraud can be carried out in many ways:  Bot traffic : Non-human traffic generated by botnets, which consist of compromised computers, cloud servers,  and proxy servers. This type of traffic is often referred to as sophisticated invalid traffic (SIVT). Click farms and device farms: A collection of devices (laptops and mobile phones) used to generate  fraudulent impressions, clicks, and conversions (e.g. app installs).",808,130,202.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2046,281,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:These farms are sometimes operated by  humans or via programs installed on the devices. Methbot and 3ve  Although there are many botnets and types of malware, the most costly botnets ever discovered are Methbot  and 3ve. These botnets were elaborate and sophisticated operations that stole an estimated US $36 million from  advertisers between 2014 and 2018. Ad fraud is rarely investigated by law enforcement, but in November 2018 the US Department of Justice (DoJ)  issued a release saying it has indicted 8 people over the Methbot and 3ve schemes. The investigation is the largest criminal investigation into ad fraud that has ever taken place and involved the  FBI, the US Department of Homeland Security, and private companies including Google and White Ops.",763,128,190.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2047,281,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad Fraud in Emerging Areas of Digital Advertising  Although ad fraud began in the display advertising world, it has moved into other emerging areas of digital  advertising such as mobile in-app and OTT/CTV. Mobile In-App Ad Fraud  Many of the ad fraud techniques used in web browsers are also found in mobile in-app environments. But there  are a few that are specific to mobile in-app. App or SDK spoofing: Similar to domain spoofing, this technique tricks advertisers into thinking that their ad  will appear in a premium app, when it will actually appear in a fraudulent app. Ad stacking: Ads are placed on top of one another so the app earns more ad revenue, but only one ad is  displayed to the user.",705,129,176.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2048,281,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Click injection: Just like click injection in web browsers, fraudsters collect ad revenue and affiliate  commissions for clicks they didn’t generate themselves. 281",164,24,41.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2049,282,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Hidden ads: Fraudsters run ads in the background of apps, giving off the impression that they are being  displayed to users when they aren’t. Malware: Malicious apps that carry out one or more of the above techniques to generate fraudulent ad  revenue. OTT & CTV  The over-the-top (OTT) and connected TV (CTV) industries are ripe for ad fraud; they are emerging and  growing areas of digital advertising with higher CPMs than other channels, there’s no direct connection  between buyers and sellers, there’s a lack of transparency, and brands are pouring more money into them. Pixalate, an ad fraud intelligence and marketing compliance company, recently uncovered two ad fraud  schemes in the OTT/CTV environment. Pixalate has named these schemes DiCaprio and Monarch .",770,128,192.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2050,282,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The DiCaprio ad fraud scheme used similar techniques found in web browsers and mobile apps to fool  advertisers into thinking that they were bidding on inventory on Roku devices. It seems that fraudsters compromised the security of the popular social networking app Grindr to send out ad  requests via a script, which contained the name DiCaprio. The ad requests appeared to come from Roku apps on Roku devices. Advertisers would bid on these ad  requests believing their ads would be shown to Roku users, when in fact they would run in the background  inside the Grindr app. The Monarch scheme used a spoofing technique to make it appear that ads would be displayed on premium  Roku apps, when actually they would end up on non-premium apps like screensavers.",760,133,190.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2051,282,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Unlike the DiCaprio  scheme that involved mobile devices, the Monarch scheme was contained to Roku apps and devices. In another ad-fraud scheme, known as Icebucket , detected by bot-mitigation company White Ops, fraudsters  impersonated more than 2 million people and generated 1.9 billion ad requests on OTT/CTV and mobile  devices. The scheme used a botnet to produce artificial viewing activity on edge devices (mainly mobile and CTV  devices). How Advertisers And Publishers Can Defend Against Ad Fraud  Combating ad fraud is an ongoing battle, but there are a couple of things publishers, brands, agencies, and  AdTech companies can do to reduce ad fraud. 1.",663,110,165.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2052,282,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Use Ad Fraud Detection Software  There are several software companies that detect and prevent many of the ad fraud techniques listed above  for different advertising channels. Many AdTech companies also provide ad-fraud detection features as part of  their offering. Below are some of the main cybersecurity and ad-fraud detection companies:  282,346,55,86.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2053,283,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:2. Adopt IAB standards  Over the past few years, the IAB have produced a number of standards to help reduce ad fraud in web  browsers and mobile apps. These include ads.txt , app-ads.txt , and sellers.json . Authorized digital sellers (ads.txt)  Ads.txt aims to tackle domain spoofing (a type of ad fraud) and arbitrage, which is a process where  impressions are bought and then repackaged and resold at a higher price by a third party. Ads.txt helps to  solve this problem by indicating who the authorized sellers and resellers of a publisher’s inventory are.",560,99,140.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2054,283,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:To adopt the standard, a publisher adds an ads.txt file containing information about all the programmatic  partners (supply-side platforms, ad exchanges, ad networks, etc.)they work with to their web server and host it  under their root domain. 283",248,40,62.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2055,284,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Advertisers or AdTech companies can then use a script to crawl the web (or a database of domains) to collect  the ads.txt files from publishers. Advertisers can then reference a publisher’s ads.txt file against IDs in OpenRTB bid requests. If there’s a  match, then advertisers can be assured that they are buying inventory from genuine publishers. 284",352,59,88.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2056,285,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:You can see whether a publisher has an ads.txt file and view the contents of it by adding /ads.txt to the end of  a root domain, e.g. businessinsider.com/ads.txt and cnn.com/ads.txt. Here’s a breakdown of the information in the above ads.txt entry:  AdTech partner – The AdTech platform, typically supply-side platforms and ad exchanges, the publisher uses  to sell their inventory. Examples include google.com appnexus.com , bidfluence.com , rubiconproject.com and  pubmatic.com . Seller Account ID – This represents the publisher’s account ID for the respective AdTech vendors and is used  to verify the authenticity of the inventory during RTB auctions. Direct or reseller – Direct means that the publisher works directly with the AdTech vendor to sell its inventory.",770,123,192.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2057,285,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Reseller means that the publisher has authorized another company to sell its inventory on its behalf. For  example, SSP2 (reseller) could sell the publisher’s inventory via SSP1 (direct). Certification Authority ID – This optional field represents the advertising system within a certification  authority, for example, the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG). Inventory type – Some publishers include this optional field so they know which type of inventory the AdTech  vendor sells (view cnn.com/ads.txt to see examples). As this hashtag represents a comment, it won’t be picked  up by the crawling script unless certain configurations are made to it, but as this is purely for the publisher’s  benefit, there’s no real need for buyers to have this information.",765,121,191.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2058,285,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Authorized digital sellers for apps (app-ads.txt)  App-ads.txt is the mobile app version of ads.txt, but with a few differences in the setup. To adopt app-ads.txt, app developers need to provide a developer website URL in app store listings and  publish an app-ads.text file. App stores are also encouraged to publish three HTML <meta> tags with the store  listing page for each individual app to allow advertisers and AdTech companies to match the bundle_id and/or  store_id in bid requests. Here’s an example of the three HTML meta tags provided by the IAB:  <meta name=""appstore:developer_url"" content=""https://www.path.to/page"" />  <meta name=""appstore:bundle_id"" content=""com.example.myapp"" />  <meta name=""appstore:store_id"" content=""SKU12345"" />  285",757,112,189.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2059,286,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Advertisers and AdTech companies then need to crawl app listing pages in app stores to retrieve these three  HTML meta tags, translate the developer URL to an app-ads.txt path, and then crawl the web for the  app-ads.txt file and interpret them. Ads.cert  Ads.cert is considered a more secure version of ads.txt and aims to increase transparency into programmatic  ad buying by providing cryptographically signed bid requests. By doing so, media buyers can be sure that the  information being sent in the bid request (e.g. the publisher’s URL, user’s location, user’s IP, and user’s device)  is factual. 286",607,103,151.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2060,287,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here’s how the process works, step by step (steps based on the IAB Tech Lab’s documentation ):  1. OpenSSL’s security software is used by the publisher to generate a pair of ECDSA keys based on the  bid request:  ○ Public (secured, yet accessible, to be read by systems which validate the bid request against  the signatures). The Public Key file must be shared via HTTP and/or HTTPS from the  287",397,75,99.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2061,288,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:publisher’s website under a relative path on the server: /ads.cert. Although ads.cert is referred  to as a file, the resource does not need to come from a file system. ○ Private (secret, secure, and inaccessible to outside systems, yet accessible to the systems that  generate and sign bid requests, e.g. SSP). Private keys are in a standard format known to  compatible security packages. 2.",391,67,97.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2062,288,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:An encrypted signature based on the bid request is generated with a private key and attached to the bid  request and sent out on behalf of the publisher by an SSP, with details about the impression available,  publisher’s website or app, industry, language, etc. 3. The recipient of the request will then use the public key to generate another signature for that same bid  request. 4. The signatures generated by the publisher and by the recipient are compared to check if they were  generated based on the same bid request (created using a matching pair of keys).",564,101,141.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2063,288,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If yes, then the bid  request is considered legit. Any alterations of the signed elements can be detected by the recipient or  other servers in the chain. The main drawback of ads.cert is that it’s only available with OpenRTB 3.0, which is not currently supported by  a majority of AdTech platforms. Sellers.json and the OpenRTB Supply Chain Object  Sellers.json allows media buyers to see all the sellers and resellers involved in a bid request. In many ways,  sellers.json is an extension to ads.txt.",502,88,125.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2064,288,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:So instead of just seeing a list of authorized sellers and resellers in an  ads.txt file, sellers.json lists the final seller of a bid request. The OpenRTB Supply Chain Object is part of sellers.json and provides a record of all the sellers (direct) and  resellers that have been involved in bid requests. By viewing all of the entities (referred to as nodes) involved in bid requests, media buyers can get more  transparency into the supply chain, identify whether the entities are partners they want to work with, and see  how many entities the bid passed through before it was delivered to publishers. Ad Viewability  Ad viewability refers to whether an ad was seen by a human or not. Although non-viewable ads can be a result of ad fraud, such as if a publisher uses bots to generate  impressions, in most cases the reason is not sinister, for example if an ad is located at the bottom of a page  where a user doesn’t scroll to.",932,172,233.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2065,288,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad viewability is one of the biggest issues in today’s online advertising world with some sources stating that  over half of all ads served are not actually viewed by an online user. A large majority of AdTech platforms do a pretty good job of determining whether an ad has been served and  whether an ad has been clicked on, but determining whether an ad was actually viewed by a user can be hard  to measure. 288",414,79,103.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2066,289,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The current industry standard provided by IAB and the Media Rating Council (MRC) states that for an ad to be  registered as viewed, it needs to have met these two criteria:  Source: MRC Viewable Ad Impression Measurement Guidelines, Version 1.0 (Final) – June 30, 2014  https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/#mrcviewable  For display ads: 50% of the ad’s pixel needs to be in the web browser’s viewport for a minimum of 1 second. For video ads: 50% of the ad’s pixel needs to be in the web browser’s viewport for a minimum of 2 seconds. Viewable Impressions  As we saw in the ad server chapter, impression trackers are used by both advertisers and publishers to track  the number of impressions an ad receives. However, this only tracks impressions that are served; it doesn’t tell us if the ad was actually viewed by a user. So not only do you need to track the number of impressions served, you also need to determine if the  impression was actually seen by a real user.",992,174,248.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2067,289,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ads may be served but not viewed because of one or more of the following reasons:  ● The ad may have taken too long to load, leaving a blank space where the ad should have been. ● The user could have scrolled down or switched tabs or windows before an ad could be displayed to  them. ● The user could be using an ad-blocking plugin like AdBlockPlus, uBlock, or Ghostery. ● There might have been some technical issues with the webpage or web browser. Also, there are a number of fraudulent long-tail sites that perform all kinds of tricks to record an ad impression,  when in fact, the ads could never be seen on the page at all.",628,121,157.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2068,290,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:What is a long-tail website? A long-tail website refers to a small publisher or individual blogger. Typically, these sites will monetize their site with Google AdSense and the inventory on these sites is  known as long-tail inventory. A lot of hope is placed in the so-called viewable impression. The idea behind viewable impression is pretty straightforward:  An advertiser pays only for ad impressions that were actually seen by a user.",438,72,109.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2069,290,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Sounds simple, but the problem is much more complex when analysed from the technical perspective.

User Privacy in Digital Advertising  Throughout history, advertising has followed the consumer through the invention and rise of new mediums,  from the print world to the online world. But the world of online advertising has brought with it a number of issues that have caused companies,  governments, and consumers to take a proactive approach to limiting the amount of user data that can be  collected. In this chapter, we’ll look at one of the biggest topics in programmatic advertising; user privacy . The Rise of Consumer Data Collection and Privacy Concerns  In the early days of online advertising, ad targeting was limited to the context of the page and information  passed to ad servers and ad networks in the user agent string (passed in a HTTP header) by web browsers,  such as:  ● The language set on the user’s computer.",837,149,209.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

It replaced the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) when it came into force on May 25, 2018. The GDPR aims to protect the data and privacy of citizens and residents of the European Union member  states  (highlighted in light blue).

In the context of digital advertising, a data subject is an EU or EEA citizen or resident whose data can be  collected by AdTech companies. Data Controller  A data controller is any person or company that collects data about EU citizens and residents. Examples include publishers, ecommerce stores, individual bloggers, brands, and companies that collect data  about users either directly or indirectly via another company. Data Processor  A data processor is any person or company that provides services or technology and collects data on behalf of  data controllers.",698,117,174.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

In simple terms, if a piece of information, either separately or combined with other pieces of data, can be used  to identify a person, then it’s classed as personal data. 294",312,54,78.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2079,295,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:‘Personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’);  an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to  an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more  factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that  natural person. Article 4 (1)  GDPR  Identity in this sense doesn’t just refer to knowing a person’s name, it also refers to identification. This means if a user visits your website or sees one of your ads, they are considered identifiable if you can  later recognize them, e.g. by identifying and recognizing them via their cookie ID or other identifier, if they  return to your website or see another one of your ads. The same principle applies to singling out an individual based on several data points, such as their postal  code, gender, and age. In this case, even though you don’t know the person’s name or have an identifier, e.g.  a user ID in a cookie saved in their browser, you could still potentially identify them.",1184,204,296.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2080,295,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:In the past, AdTech vendors and most MarTech vendors have based their privacy policies on the fact that they  are not collecting or dealing with personal data because online identifiers, such as cookie IDs, IP addresses,  device advertising IDs, and device fingerprints were not considered examples of personal data. However, under the GDPR, any piece of data or information that can in some way identify a person is classed  as personal data. Apart from personal data, the GDPR also refers to two other types of data: pseudonymous and anonymous . Pseudonymous data refers to data that’s been changed into a non-identifiable format, rendering it unable to  identify a person without the use of additional data, such as the hashing function or encryption keys. ‘Pseudonymization’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no  longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such  additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure  that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.",1175,193,293.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2081,295,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Article 4 (5)  GDPR  Anonymous data means that it can’t be used to identify a person, which, for this reason, offers little value to  online advertising and marketing companies as they are in the business of identifying people and targeting  them with ads and marketing messages. 295",283,51,70.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2082,296,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Due to its inability to identify a person, anonymous data is not subject to the rules of the GDPR, meaning if a  company collects anonymous data, they don’t have to obtain user consent. ... The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information  which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous  in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not, therefore,  concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.

2086,297,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:While that is true in most cases, it’s important to keep in mind that the anonymized data could still be linked to  an individual if enough pieces of data are combined together. For example, having a single data point, like an age range of 40–50, out of a sample size of 1,000 couldn’t be  linked to an individual, but when you add in other anonymized data sets (e.g. postcodes and the year of birth)  and combine with other sets of data (e.g. public records or data), it can easily become personal data and could  be used to identify an individual. 297",553,105,138.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2087,298,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Did you know? There have been a number of situations of anonymized data becoming re-identifiable, with one example  being Netflix’s 2006 contest in which the company put up a $1 million prize for the person or team who could  significantly improve their recommendation algorithm. As part of the content, Netflix released 10 million  movie rankings by 500,000 customers, which included the following information:  ● A unique subscriber ID  ● Movie title  ● Year of release  ● The date on which the subscriber rated the movie  Even though personally identifiable information, such as customer name, was replaced with a unique ID, two  researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, were able to  de-anonymize some of the data and identify certain users by comparing user ratings and the date on which  they rated the movies with information from the site Internet Movie Database (IMDB). A Side Note About Sensitive Data  The GDPR also includes another type of data class: sensitive data . Examples of sensitive data include religious or philosophical beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,  trade-union membership, and data concerning health, sex life, and sexual orientation.",1231,205,307.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2088,298,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Sensitive data is typically not collected by advertisers or marketers as it requires stronger grounds for  processing and is subject to additional protections, meaning the payoff just isn’t viable. Advertisers and marketers wishing to collect, store, and use sensitive data should be aware that they will need  to obtain explicit consent from the data subject. What Does This Mean for AdTech From a Technical Perspective? The definition of personal data is somewhat unchanged from the definition given in the Directive; however, it  broadened the scope of the data-protection law. One example of the change in scope is that the GDPR now considers online identifiers and location data as  personal data.",702,114,175.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2089,298,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:As most online advertisers, marketers, and publishers collect and use online identifiers, such as those  mentioned above, as well as location data, they will now have to take additional steps to ensure they are  compliant with the GDPR’s rules regarding the collection, storage, and usage of personal data. Examples of personal data include:  ● Names  ● Email, home, and work addresses  298",390,67,97.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2090,299,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Phone numbers  ● Cookie IDs (visitor identifiers stored in cookies)  ● IP addresses  ● Device IDs  ● Device fingerprints  The GDPR states that companies collecting personal data should implement measures to ensure the data is  protected at all times, for instance, via encryption and pseudonymization. Although most companies already do this with obvious examples of personal data, such as emails, phone  numbers, and IP addresses, they now have to apply this to all types of data they collect. While these measures will help online advertising and marketing companies mitigate risks associated with data  security, encrypted and pseudonymized data are still classed as personal data, meaning companies still have  to obtain user consent and carry out various data-protection measures if they wish to collect and use the  information. The main challenges advertising and marketing companies face with personal data are collecting it in the first  place (i.e. obtaining consent), ensuring its security, and creating a chain of responsibility with their partners  when they exchange data with them. The European Union’s ePrivacy Directive  The ePrivacy directive is a piece of EU legislation that also aims to protect the data and privacy of EU and EEA  citizens and residents, but with a focus on respecting their private lives when using electronic communications.",1366,224,341.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2091,299,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Within the online advertising and marketing industries, the current ePrivacy directive is often conversationally  referred to as the cookie law because it regulates the usage of cookies, among other identifiers. However, it relates to the protection of privacy in the electronic-communications sector as a whole, not just the  usage of cookies for online advertising and marketing. One of the most prominent consequences of the ePrivacy directive (officially known as the Privacy and  Electronic Communications Directive, 2002/58/EC) is the cookie-consent notices — also known as cookie  bars — like the one below from bbc.co.uk:  A common identifier of the current EU ePrivacy directive is the cookie-information banners displayed to EU  citizens, which will likely be superseded by a new user-consent form under the GDPR and ePrivacy  regulations. Currently, ePrivacy is a directive, but is in the process of being transformed into a regulation, which will also  repeal the current directive. 299",998,158,249.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2092,300,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Once adopted, ePrivacy will regulate the processes of placing, accessing, and using identification technologies  on users’ devices based on the broadened definition of personal data as recognized by the GDPR (e.g.  cookies, device advertising IDs, and IP addresses). It is not known when the ePrivacy regulation will come into force as the proposal is set to be negotiated  between the three EU legislative institutions (see below). Given that it is still in progress, the final version of the ePrivacy regulation may still affect how AdTech  platforms interact with online identifiers based on the GDPR itself and the current state of ePrivacy. What’s the difference between GDPR and ePrivacy? Both the GDPR and ePrivacy are based on Articles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a document  containing the rights and freedoms protected in the EU.",852,140,213.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2093,300,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The GDPR is based on Article 8 and relates to the protection of personal data, whereas ePrivacy is based on  Article 7 and relates to respect for private life. In simple terms, the GDPR is focused on data protection, and ePrivacy is focused on the right to respect a  data subject’s private and family life, home, and communications. Also, ePrivacy is lex specialis of the GDPR, meaning that when the two regulations cover the same situation,  ePrivacy will override the GDPR. The Current State of ePrivacy  In December 2016, a draft of the proposed ePrivacy regulation was leaked, with the first official draft formally  released by the European Commission in January 2017. On October 19, 2017, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (aka  LIBE Committee) voted to approve an amended version of the ePrivacy regulation.",863,146,215.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2094,300,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This amended version was  then approved by members of the European Parliament during a plenary session (a meeting of the whole  Parliament). Another draft was released in March 2019, with subsequent proposals released in March 2019 and November  2019 . The drafts have been met with some strong opposition from various advertising and marketing organizations,  including the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe (IAB Europe) and Digital Europe — whose members  include Google, Apple, Microsoft, and IBM — with their main concerns centered around the lawfulness of data  processing based on the notion of legitimate interest. 300",629,101,157.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018  The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a law passed by the California State Legislature on June 28,  2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020. Enforcement of the act began on July 1, 2020. The goal of the CCPA is to make it easier for Californian citizens and residents to know the types of personal  information businesses collect about them, and give them the right not to agree to the sale of their personal  data to other parties  The CCPA provides Californian citizens and residents with the following rights:  ● Right to know all the data a business collects about them.",921,162,230.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

2099,302,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Also, the CCPA allows affected consumers to take individual or class-action lawsuits against offending  businesses, which should be a more serious financial concern for potential violators. Damages range between  $100 and $750 – or more, if actual damages are proven. The Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Personal Data  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a term regularly used in AdTech, but it extends well past this industry. In fact, PII is often referenced by US government agencies, such as the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) . NIST provides the following definition of PII:  PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be  used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of  birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an  individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.",1060,168,265.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2100,302,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A very similar definition is provided by US Government’s Office of Management and Budget :  The term “personally identifiable information” refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an  individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc.alone, or when  combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such  as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. What Pieces of Information are Considered PII? PII can be divided into two categories: linked information and linkable information . Linked information is any piece of personal information that can be used to identify an individual and includes,  but is not limited to, the following:  ● Full name  ● Home address  ● Email address  ● Social security number  ● Passport number  ● Driver’s license number  ● Credit card numbers  ● Date of birth  ● Telephone number  ● Internet protocol (IP) address  Linkable information, on the other hand, is information that on its own may not be able to identify a person, but  when combined with another piece of information could identify, trace, or locate a person.",1187,206,296.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2101,303,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Here are some examples of linkable information:  ● First or last name (if common)  ● Country, state, city, postcode  ● Gender  ● Race  ● Non-specific age (e.g. 30-40 instead of 30)  ● Job position and workplace  Non-PII  There’s a lot of grey area around whether identifiers like cookie IDs and device IDs are examples of PII or  non-PII. While the definition of PII doesn’t include a specific reference to cookie IDs or device IDs, the Guide to  Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the NIST suggests that they are  classed as PII (emphasis ours):  Asset information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) address or other  host-specific persistent static identifier that consistently links to a particular person or small,  well-defined group of people . However, many AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers class cookie IDs and device IDs as non-PII. 303",931,160,232.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2102,304,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:One could argue that cookie IDs and device IDs can be deleted or reset and therefore aren’t persistent forever,  but the same could be said for other types of PII such as home addresses, email addresses, and password  numbers that can change more than once during a person’s life. The Definition of Personal Data  As we mentioned above in the section about the GDPR, personal data is a term used in the European Union to  define a piece of information that can be used to identify a person. Examples of personal data include:  ● Names  ● Email, home, and work addresses  ● Phone numbers  ● Cookie IDs (visitor identifiers stored in cookies)  ● IP addresses  ● Device IDs  ● Device fingerprints  What’s the Difference Between PII and Personal Data? While PII is a commonly recognized term, there is another term that many people may be familiar with —  personal data. The difference between PII and personal data can be explained by the following:  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a term used mainly within the USA.",1027,189,256.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2103,304,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Personal data is a term used in the EU’s GDPR. Even though it is considered to be the European equivalent  of PII, it doesn’t completely correspond to the PII definition popular in the US. Browser Settings  Although popular web browsers have long provided some level of privacy protection in the form of DoNotTrack ,  few have implemented technical settings to strengthen user privacy when browsing the web. 304",411,71,102.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2104,305,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:But this has all changed over the past few years with the most popular web browsers by market share —  Google Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox, and Apple’s Safari — making gradual changes to how their web browsers  handle cookies and other storage and tracking methods (e.g. device fingerprinting) to strengthen privacy for  users. Let’s now take a look at how web browsers have strengthened user privacy and the impact these changes  have had on digital advertising. Apple’s Safari  Apple’s first real initiative to strengthen user privacy came in 2015 when they allowed iOS users to install  content blockers (a form of ad blocking). These content blockers can be downloaded from the App Store and used to prevent certain content (e.g. ads)  and tracking cookies from loading in the Safari web browser on Apple smartphones and tablets. Then, in September 2017, Apple stepped up their privacy game by introducing Intelligent Tracking Prevention  (ITP) with the release of Safari 11 and iOS 11.",987,168,246.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2105,305,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:ITP is a feature of Webkit, an open-source web-browser engine that powers Apple’s Safari web browser, that  aims to further protect users’ online privacy by changing the way Safari handles user identification methods,  such as first- and third-party cookies. The way ITP works is by classifying domains that are capable of tracking users across different domains via its  Machine Learning Classifier. Since its initial release, ITP has strengthened user privacy by limiting the lifespan of cookies and other data  storage methods with every new update. Here’s an overview of the main restrictions ITP places on cookies and other browser storage methods as per  ITP 2.3:  ● Third-party cookies are blocked by default. ● First-party cookies created by JavaScript’s Document.cookie API are set to expire in 7 days.",811,133,202.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2106,305,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● First-party cookies created by JavaScript’s Document.cookie API, classified as a tracking domain by the  Machine Learning Classifier, and created via a link containing a query string or id fragment (known as  link decoration) are set to expire in 24 hours. ● Data stored in local storage is set to expire in 7 days. ● All cookies created by a third-party CNAME-cloaked HTTP response will be set to expire in 7 days. ● In 2021, ITP will add a new feature that will hide a user’s IP address from trackers.

2107,305,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main problem companies in the digital advertising industry face when it comes to ITP is that it’s harder to  identify users across different websites.

2109,306,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Relevance for users: Although most people are uneasy with ads that follow them around the web, many  users will click on or interact with ads if they are relevant to them; for example, an ad for a upcoming Metallica  concert at CenturyLink Field would be of great interest to a heavy-metal fan living in Seattle. 4. Attribution: One of the most overlooked areas of this whole identity problem is attribution. It’s estimated that  global digital ad spend in 2019 will reach $316 billion , and without an accurate way to identify users as they  move across the Internet and devices, it will be hard to track performance and know where to assign budgets. In response to the limitations imposed on them by ITP, many AdTech companies have created workarounds,  but these have either been eliminated or restricted with new releases of ITP.",833,147,208.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

The second decrypts the web  address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. This separation of information protects the  user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit. Mail Privacy Protection  This feature will prevent email senders from using invisible pixels to identify when a user opens an email. It will  also mask a user’s IP address so that it can’t be used to determine their location or linked with other online  activity.,613,110,153.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

The Hide My Mail feature will throw a spanner in the works for ID graphs and ID solutions built around email  addresses. As these changes will only apply to iCloud+ subscriptions, not every Apple user will be covered by these  changes.

The filter does not get rid of ads completely (like a regular ad blocker), but protects the user from the most  disruptive ads. The filtered ads, according to www.betterads.org , include certain types of desktop ads:  ● Pop-up ads  ● Auto-playing videos with sound  ● Prestitial ads with a countdown  ● Large sticky ads  The types of mobile ad experiences least preferred by consumers and not complying by Better Ads Standard  for ads on mobile devices include:  ● Pop-up ads  ● Prestitial ads  ● Mobile pages with more than 30% ad density  ● Flashing animations  ● Postitial ads that require a countdown to dismiss  ● Full-screen scrollover ads  ● Large sticky ads  ● Auto-playing videos with sound  310",1052,190,263.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

In short, website developers have to include a new “ SameSite ” attribute (specifically, SameSite=None) when  setting a cookie to tell Chrome which cookies are to be used only by the current site or current URL that the  user is on, and which ones are cross-site cookies.",1157,207,289.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2120,312,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Developers will also have to add the ‘Secure’ attribute as cookies will only be set via HTTPS. Even though this attribute applies to Chrome, which was the first browser to support this attribute, it shouldn’t  cause any issues in other browsers that don’t support it. 312",271,47,67.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2121,313,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Setting cookies in this way will eventually help Chrome understand which ones are first party and which ones  are third party. In the future, Chrome could then ask users if they want to block third-party cookies. If the user says ‘yes’, then  cookies created with `SameSite=None` will be blocked. Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  On August 22, 2019, Google announced a new initiative that aims to make the web more privacy friendly, but  still allows online advertising to work in a limited capacity. This initiative is known as Privacy Sandbox.",538,92,134.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2122,313,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Google is quick to reiterate that blocking third-party cookies completely without providing a solid alternative  (like what Safari and Firefox have done) is detrimental to the future of the Internet (and the back pockets of  publishers). It also acknowledges that users are demanding more control over their privacy. Instead of blocking third-party cookies altogether, Privacy Sandbox provides a secure environment for  personalization while still protecting user privacy. Here are the key things to know about Privacy Sandbox:  ● It’s an open solution and Google has asked for feedback and input from other web browsers,  publishers, and advertising technology (AdTech) companies on how to advance it. ● It is being positioned as a new web standard, rather than a new privacy feature.",785,126,196.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2123,313,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● It will likely allow ads to still be relevant for users, but only anonymous and aggregated data would be  available to AdTech companies and advertisers. Also, a lot more user data will stay on the device,  instead of being passed on to AdTech companies. ● Google acknowledges that it can't go it alone and will require input and feedback from other companies  and organizations. ● It’s expected that Privacy Sandbox will go live in 2033. Chrome’s Plans to Kill Off Third-Party Cookies and the Move To Privacy Sandbox  On Tuesday the 14th of January, 2020, Google made an announcement that most people in the online  advertising industry never thought they would hear — Google will kill off third-party cookies by 2022.",720,127,180.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2124,313,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This announcement follows in the footsteps of their previous initiatives (listed above) and is the next step in  Google Chrome’s ongoing commitment to making the web a more privacy friendly place, while still allowing  companies, including Google, to earn money from online advertising. Here are the main things you need to know about this new announcement:  ● Google Chrome plans to stop supporting third-party cookies by 2022. ● It will run a series of trials in 2020 to see how conversion measuring and personalization can work  without using third-party cookies. This will involve using Privacy Sandbox (see above). ● The personalization element will probably be interest-based personalization on an aggregated level,  rather than 1:1 personalization that has stood as the holy grail for advertisers and marketers for over a  decade.",837,136,209.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2125,314,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● The ultimate goal will be to replace third-party cookies used for ad selection and measurement with  Privacy Sandbox. As they’ve stated previously, Google doesn’t see strict privacy features, like those seen by Safari and Firefox,  as the way forward for the Internet and online advertising. Google feels that these approaches only encourage companies to create workarounds and develop techniques  like device fingerprinting, which further diminish user privacy and provide little or no control. Just like with other sandboxes used in computer security, Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox will execute advertising  processes in a restricted environment, which is in stark contrast to how these processes are carried out today. There are three parts to Privacy Sandbox:  ● Replacing cross-site tracking processes — i.e. the ones currently powered by third-party cookies.",861,133,215.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2126,314,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Phasing out third-party cookies by separating first-party and third-party cookies via the SameSite  attribute and turning off support for third-party cookies. ● Mitigating workarounds such as fingerprinting. On Thursday June 24, 2021, Google Chrome announced that it would be extending its planned sunset of  third-party cookies by 2 years. It’s currently expected that Chrome will shut off support for third-party cookies  starting from the middle of 2023. Although it’s still in development, Privacy Sandbox puts forward a completely new way of how online  advertising works, particularly around identification, ad targeting , and measurement .",648,99,162.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2127,314,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Identification in Privacy Sandbox  As part of its plans to improve user privacy, Privacy Sandbox won’t identify individual users. This also means  there probably won’t be an ID that replaces cookies — i.e. no browser IDs. This is the biggest change that the online advertising industry will have to get used to, as publishers, brands,  agencies, and AdTech vendors have built their businesses around identifying individuals across the web via  third-party cookies. Although many AdTech vendors will turn to other identifiers such as first-party cookies, it’s impossible to rule  out the possibility of Chrome limiting the use of first-party cookies and other techniques for identification, like  what Safari has done with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Ad Targeting in Privacy Sandbox  The ad-targeting options in Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox will be fairly similar to the ones available today, but  won't rely on user-level identification.",944,150,236.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2128,314,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main ad targeting processes in Privacy Sandbox are contextual and first-party-data targeting ,  interest-based targeting via Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) , and remarketing (aka retargeting) . 314",207,30,51.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2129,315,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:With this method, users will be displayed ads that match the context of the page they’re visiting, similar to how  contextual advertising works today. The only difference is that Privacy Sandbox will be responsible for informing AdTech platforms about the  context of the page, rather than the AdTech platforms themselves (e.g. via web crawlers and the user agent  string). 315",377,63,94.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2130,316,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:With interest-based targeting, a user will be added to a group based on the websites they visit. Advertisers will  be able to target them based on the groups they belong to. 316",177,33,44.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2131,317,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The important thing to note here is that targeting will be done on a cohort level, meaning no user data will be  passed to AdTech platforms, just the name of the interest group they belong to. This new way of running  targeted ad campaigns is in stark contrast to how it’s done currently. Google Chrome announced on January 25, 2021, that it would make the FLoC API publicly available for testing  in March 2021, and begin testing FLoC in Google Ads in Q2 2021. These tests were released in most  countries, except for countries in Europe as Google is not yet sure if FLoC complies with the GDPR. Based on the tests Google’s ad teams have conducted using FLoC, it claims that advertisers can expect to see  at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising for  reaching in-market and affinity Google Audiences.",852,154,213.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2132,317,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Then, on January 25, 2022, Google announced that it would be sunsetting FLoC and replacing it with a new  initiative — Topics API . Topics will enable advertisers to show ads to users based on the websites they visit, rather than the cohort they  belong to. A classifier model will map website hostnames to topics and only subdomains and root domains will  be included and not the full URL. For example, the website football.news.com will have the topic of football  associated with it, but news.com/sport will have topics related to news.com associated with it. There are currently around 350 categories that will be included in the Topics API, but it’s likely that this number  will change.",692,121,173.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2133,319,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The remarketing (aka retargeting) method is similar to the interest-based targeting method above, with the  main difference being how the ad-decisioning process works. With interest-based targeting, advertisers can show ads to users based on the interest groups they belong to. With the remarketing method, the browser will send two ad requests to the AdTech platform — one containing  contextual information and one referencing the interest group that the user belongs to. The process Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox will use for remarketing is known as Two Uncorrelated Requests,  Then Locally-Executed Decision On Victory (TURTLEDOVE). The AdTech platform won’t know that these two ad requests are coming from the same user, hence the name  ‘two uncorrelated requests’.",765,118,191.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2134,319,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The reason for this is to make it hard for AdTech platforms to identify users by  connecting the time the two requests are sent. The interesting thing about this proposed approach is that many of the key ad-decisioning and even auction  mechanics will be conducted client side (i.e. in the Chrome browser) instead of server side by AdTech  platforms. Other Proposals in Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  Apart from the standards mentioned above, there are many others that have been put forward by Google and  other companies, including AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers. Some of these proposals include:  SPARROW: A proposal from Criteo in response to Chrome’s TURTLEDOVE. Dovekey: A follow-up proposal to Criteo’s SPARROW from various teams at Google.",757,124,189.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2135,319,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:PARROT: A proposal from Magnite that’s designed to maintain the privacy aspects of TURTLEDOVE but put  control of the auction decisioning in hands of publishers by utilizing Fenced Frames (another proposal from the  Google Chrome team). TERN: a proposal from AdTech company NextRoll. The goal of TERN is to propose improvements to  TURTLEDOVE based on information collected from GitHub issues and repos. Fenced Frames: An API proposal created by Google engineers that would allow ads on a web page to load  without the rest of the page knowing what ad is being displayed. The Fenced Frames API would be used to  communicate with other Privacy Sandbox standards, like TURTLEDOVE, to show interest-based ads.",706,118,176.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2136,319,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:FLEDGE: A proposal from Google that’s designed to be an early prototype of ad-serving processes in  TURTLEDOVE. FLEDGE also incorporates components of the proposals made by independent AdTech  companies (i.e. the ones listed above). A full list of proposals can be found on the W3C’s Web Advertising Business Group Github repository . 319,338,55,84.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2137,320,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Mobile IDs  Although most of the privacy changes over the past few years have been focused on web browsers, they are  now starting to enter the in-app mobile world. The two main mobile operating systems are Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. Source: Statcounter  Just like in the web-browser world, Apple has made a number of changes to iOS to increase user privacy over  the past few years, including:  Limit Ad Tracking (LAT): An option that allows iOS users to opt out of targeted advertising. When enabled,  the user’s IDFA will be zeroed out (i.e. the random numbers and letters will be replaced with zeros) when  accessed by apps and AdTech companies. Opt out of location-based Apple Ads: This option allows iOS and macOS users to opt out of location-based  ads served by Apple.",783,141,195.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2138,320,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Grant or deny access to location data: The new release of iOS 13 brought with it an update to location data  controls. Firstly, users were periodically shown messages informing them of certain ads that were using their location  data in the background (i.e. when not actually using the app in question). 320",307,54,76.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2139,321,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Secondly, Apple presented users with a choice about whether an app could use their location data. Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) Framework  During its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced that it would be introducing a series  of privacy changes in iOS, iPadOs, and tvOS. One of the main changes was to change how its mobile identifier (IDFA) is accessed by app developers,  AdTech companies, and mobile measurement platforms (MMPs). As of iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and tvOS 14.5, if app developers, AdTech companies, and MMPs want to collect  a user’s IDFA, they’ll have to obtain consent via Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) Framework. The framework involves showing users a message, similar to the one below, asking them if they can track  them across different apps.",798,127,199.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2140,322,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If users accept, then their IDFA will be collected. If they reject it, then the IDFA will still be collected but will be  zeroed out, making it useless from an identification point of view. The image on the left illustrates how the IDFA is accessed now. The image on the right illustrates how the IDFA can be accessed in iOS 14.5  322",334,64,83.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2141,323,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Apple’s ATT framework has a very similar impact to the loss of third-party cookies in web browsers as it limits  cross-app identification. In turn, this makes personalized ad targeting, retargeting, measurement, and  attribution very limited. Although Apple hasn’t put forward a solution to ad targeting, it has released a solution for app install attribution  via its SKAdNetwork. Apple’s SKAdNetwork  Apple’s SKAdNetwork aims to provide conversion data to advertisers but without revealing any user-level or  device-level data. It’s Apple’s version of a privacy-friendly way to attribute app installs.",603,92,150.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2142,324,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A couple of points about the SKAdNetwork:  ● The IDFA won’t be passed to AdTech platforms or MMPs, even if the user has opted in. ● All attribution data will pass through SKAdNetwork and then onto the AdTech platform or MMP. In iOS  and iPadOS 15 onwards, advertisers will also be able to receive the postback information. ● SKAdNetwork will only attribute app installs (via the last-click model) and not view-through conversions. ● Campaign IDs are limited to 100 per AdTech platform (e.g. ad network or MMP).",510,89,127.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2143,324,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Apple’s Privacy Changes in iOS 15 and iPad 15  With the release of iOS 15, iPad 15, and watchOS 15, Apple will introduce a feature known as the App Privacy  Report. The App Privacy Report will give users more insights into how apps use things like their location, photos,  camera, microphone, and contacts. The report will show users how apps have accessed that information in the past 7 days and can deny access  to that information by changing the settings. The App Privacy Report will also show users which third-party domains the app has been contacting so that  users can see which companies their data is potentially being shared with. Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID)  Although Google hasn’t announced any significant changes to its Android advertising ID (AAID), it has hinted  at making some changes in the future .",830,146,207.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2144,324,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Google recently announced that it will require app developers to include privacy information in their Google  Play Store listings, similar to the privacy information displayed in Apple’s App Store listings. Then in July 2021, Google announced that it would stop passing on its AAID if the user had opted out of  personalized advertising. These changes went live with the release of Android 12 in the later part of 2021. While this is considered a privacy change, it’s not as stringent as the ones released by Apple. Ad Blockers  Ad blockers emerged in the mid-2000s and have risen in popularity over the past decade due in part to the  growing concerns over user privacy and the pure annoyance of some ads (e.g. popup ads).",723,127,180.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2145,324,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Although there are several ad-blocking methods, the most popular method by far is via web browser plugins  like AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, and uBlock. How Do Ad Blockers Work? Most ad-blocking plugins work by preventing JavaScript and other elements from loading. This is achieved by  adding domains used to serve ads to a blacklist and by identifying elements used for displaying ads, such as  class=”advertisement”, class=”banner_ad”, and alt=”ad” from loading. 324",464,73,116.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2146,325,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Because most ad blockers stop AdTech JavaScript tags from loading, they not only stop ads from being  displayed but also stop third-party cookies from being created. This means publishers miss out on ad revenue. To highlight how ad blockers work, below we illustrate the normal ad-serving process where an ad is sent from  an advertiser and displayed to a user on a website, and then how the process looks when an ad-blocking  plugin is used. 325",446,79,111.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2147,326,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:And here’s the same process but with an ad blocker:  Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what’s happening in the image above:  1. A user visits a website and the browser sends a request to the publisher’s web server asking for the  page’s content. 2. The publisher’s web server returns the HTML and it starts rendering the page’s content. 3.,342,62,85.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2148,326,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The ad blocker extension scans the HTML, and:  A. Blocks the requests to load external resources, such as an ad request to the ad server  domain (the ad request is not made). B. Hides certain HTML elements from appearing, such as class=’’ad’’. The Impact Ad Blockers Have On The Digital Advertising Industry  The impact of ad blockers on publishers is immediate, severe, and costly. It’s estimated that ad blockers will  c ost publishers $27 billion in lost ad revenue in 2020. 326",481,86,120.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2149,327,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:According to G rowth of the Blocked Web 2020 PageFair Adblock Report by Blockthrough , over 615 million  devices (desktop and mobile) worldwide have some sort of ad blocking software installed. 327",197,33,49.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2150,328,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Source: Growth of the Blocked Web 2020 PageFair Adblock Report, Blockthrough . What Can Publishers Do About Ad Blockers? When it comes to addressing the issue of ad blockers, publishers first need to find out if a user is using  ad-blocking software, and then use a variety of tactics to handle it. How can publishers detect if someone is using an ad blocker? Although it’s difficult to bypass ad-blocking software, it’s possible to determine whether someone is using an ad  blocker by testing whether particular elements of the page have been displayed.",554,94,138.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2151,328,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Typically, testing for the presence of an ad blocker involves adding a “bait” script — a tiny piece of code that an  ad blocker is likely to interpret as an ad — to the publisher’s website. This bait script could contain a class  name like “banner_ad”, which would likely be blocked by an ad blocker. Examples of bait scripts and anti-ad-blocking scripts  Ad-block-detection scripts that are based on the aforementioned “bait” method take just a couple lines of  code to implement. There are a few providers offering ready-made ad-block detecting scripts:  Detectadblock  Detectadblock.com proposes a method that requires a piece of JavaScript code to be saved. The method  involves a hidden <div> section saved to a file called “ads.js”, placed in the root directory of the website:  var e=document.createElement('div');  e.id='RZfrHsidDwbG';  e.style.display='none';  document.body.appendChild(e);  Publishers place the following JavaScript within their website’s HTML source code just above the </body>  tag.",1011,161,252.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2152,328,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Its purpose is to check if the hidden DIV created within “ads.js” exists (ads are allowed) or not (ads are  being blocked). <script src=""/ads.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>  <script type=""text/javascript"">  if(document.getElementById('RZfrHsidDwbG')){  alert('Blocking Ads: No');  } else {  alert('Blocking Ads: Yes');  }  </script>  IAB Script  The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), an advertising-business organization that develops industry  standards, runs its own tech lab and has also proposed its own ad-block-detection script. It creates a set of  “bait” DIVs likely to be blocked by browser-based ad-blocking tools. The script is really simple to set up, and  328",682,104,170.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

BlockAdBlock  BlockAdBlock is a community-developed anti-ad-blocking script. Similar to the aforementioned methods, it’s  very simple and effective. The bait used by BlockAdBlock looks like this:  baitClass: 'pub_300x250 pub_300x250m pub_728x90 text-ad textAd text_ad text_ads text-ads text-ad-links'  This means it will trigger ad-blocking software by referencing typical names and popular IAB-recommended  ad-image sizes: 300x250px, 300x250px, and the skyscraper 728x90px.

Once a publisher determines that a user is using an ad blocker, they  can then decide how to deal with it.

2157,331,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:7 Tactics Publishers Can Use to Deal With Ad Blockers  The tactics provided by the IAB cover a range of possible implementations and can be used separately or in  conjunction with others. All of the seven recommendations listed by the IAB come with their own risks and benefits. The IAB suggests  publishers weigh up the risks and benefits and consider the type of relationship they have with their audience  before deploying a tactic. Here’s a brief recap of the items mentioned in the Publisher Ad-Blocking Primer and some examples of what  they look like in action. 1.,571,102,142.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2158,331,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Notice  This tactic involves publishers detecting an ad blocker and then taking one or more of the following actions:  Educating and informing the user about the negative implications of ad blockers and the value of advertising  (e.g. free content in exchange for viewing an ad). Requesting the user disable the ad-blocking software in order to continue. Asking the user to donate money to avoid seeing ads. Telling the user that if they want to use an ad blocker, their experience will be limited. The aim of the Notice tactic isn’t necessarily to force the user to disable their ad blocker, but to start a  conversation regarding their ad-blocking choices and encourage them to take a certain action.",702,121,175.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2159,332,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:2. Access Denial  Access denial goes one step further by restricting access to the site (or parts of the site) until the user has  completed an action proposed by the publisher — e.g. switching the ad blocker off, subscribing, registering, or  making a donation. An example of the Access Denial tactic can be found on Forbes:  3. Tiered Experience  Unlike the above tactic that denies the user access to content, the tiered experience method works by  delivering a limited or modified experience to a user who has an ad blocker installed while delivering the full  experience to a user who doesn’t. For example, a publisher may only allow users with an enabled ad blocker to read five articles per month, but  let users without ad blockers read a higher or unlimited number of articles.",786,142,196.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2160,332,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This tactic is similar to paywalls publishers use to encourage visitors to take out a paid subscription:  Source: The New York Times  332,137,25,34.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2161,333,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Source: The Economist  4. Payment From Visitors  The payment from visitors tactic can relate to both monetary and non-monetary payments. For example, a publisher may ask the visitor to pay a small fee to access the content or provide their email  address. Examples include:  Subscription: A visitor pays or provides some information (e.g. a name and email address) for continued  access to the content, just like in the example below from bild.de. Punch-Card: A visitor pays for a set number of accesses (e.g. $10 for 10 articles).",531,92,132.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2162,333,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Timed Pass: A visitor pays for access for a limited period of time (e.g. $10 for one month). Members-Only Section: A visitor pays for access to content or features only available to paying members. 5. Ad Reinsertion  Publishers can also resort to ad reinsertion, which is arguably the least ethical and user-friendly way to fight ad  blockers. The term describes the practice of finding ways to serve ads to users that have an ad blocker installed.",448,78,112.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2163,333,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad  reinsertion may be done with or without the permission of the adblock software provider. While this technique may actually stop ads from being blocked (at least for some time), actual short-term and  long-term implications of ad reinsertion are still unknown—in fact it’s advertising to people who explicitly don’t  want to be advertised to. 333",349,58,87.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2164,334,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The method is a constant cat-and-mouse game that may involve a lot of effort on the publisher’s side, but  ultimately bring little benefit. Ad reinsertion is comprised of three main methods:  Obfuscation: This method attempts to avoid ad-blocking software by changing the names of the ads and their  location on the page. In browser: Similar to above, this method aims to avoid being picked up by ad blockers by using software in  the browser to change the requests sent to the ad resources. On server: Using a process known as server-side ad stitching (a.k.a.ad insertion or dynamic ad insertion), this  method delivers the ad from the same server as the content or service, which avoids detection from ad  blockers.",717,125,179.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2165,334,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:6. Payment to Ad Blocker Companies  All of the aforementioned tactics relate to technology solutions, whereas this is more of a business solution to  the ad-blocker problem. Payment to ad blocker companies involves buying your way onto ad-blocker whitelists  so your ads are not blocked by the software. Adblock Plus (ABP), one of the most popular ad blockers, has created a program called Acceptable Ads  Program, in which companies can apply to its whitelist so their ads can still run even if the ABP software is  active. Here’s a snapshot of ABP’s whitelist:  In the image above, you can see that Amazon ads are on the whitelist, which means they should still appear  even if the ABP software is active.",707,127,176.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2166,335,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:7. Payment to Visitors  Similar to the previous strategy, this one involves paying or rewarding visitors for their time spent with  advertising. Examples of this include sharing a portion of ad revenue with users and giving them extra playing  time if they view ads on a mobile game. 8. Native Ads  Another effective way to circumvent ad-blocking software is to display native ads.",381,67,95.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2167,335,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Native ads are inherently more difficult to detect, as the ad content is implemented in such a way to largely  resemble the original content on the website. Native in-feed ads match the original editorial content in form and function, making them difficult to detect. This is a very effective way to monetize content, and is used by some of the biggest players in the industry,  including Facebook , LinkedIn , Tumblr , Twitter , and Instagram . Major news media—including Time , Forbes , The  Wall Street Journal , and The New York Times , quickly sensed potential and jumped on the native bandwagon. However, because most native ads are served via third-party AdTech platforms and contain similar elements to  banner ads (e.g. class=”native-ad”), there’s still a chance that they’ll be detected and blocked.",809,138,202.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2168,335,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Opting Out Of Online Behavioral Advertising  Online behavioral advertising (OBA) simply means targeting online consumers with ads that align with their  online behavior — typically, what types of websites they visit. So for example, if you regularly visit websites about cooking, you will more than likely see ads about cooking,  such as kitchen products and cookbooks. Behavioral targeting helps advertisers display ads that are relevant to your needs and interests. However,  some consumers wish not to receive these types of ads as they don’t like the fact that companies collect  information about them. How can Internet users opt-out of behavioral or targeted online advertising?",684,109,171.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2169,336,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Solution # 1: Unchecking the opt-in option found on a web page. Some websites include an option for you to opt-out of marketing for that site. It’s important to note that by doing  so, you are only opting out of this particular site and it won’t opt you out of other sites. When a user opts out or a particular site, a cookie is set in the first-party cookie of the publisher. This cookie is  then checked, typically by a tag manager, before any tags get served.",462,89,115.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2170,336,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:If the opt-out cookie is detected, the tags  aren't fired. Solution #2: Turning off the personalization feature on popular search engines (i.e. Google, Bing,  Yahoo!)and other sites (e.g. Amazon and Facebook). 336",213,34,53.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2171,337,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:You can not only opt out of behavioral targeting but can also change the settings in your web browser so that  you are displayed ads that are more relevant and of interest to you. If you turn this option off, then you will still see ads, but they will be general and location-based ones, rather  than ones that match your interests. When a user opts out from search engines and accounts, the opt-out request is set at the account level, rather  than saved as a first-party cookie. So when you're logged in to the site, the website (e.g. Facebook, Google,  Amazon, etc.)knows that you have opted out and therefore doesn't personalize the ads or pass additional  information about you to the ad platforms.",703,128,175.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2172,337,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:However, this method of opting out does not prevent these companies from collecting data about your  behavior; it just means they won’t use data collected about you for ad personalization. 337",192,32,48.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2173,338,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Solution #3: Requesting AdTech vendors and their clients to not track you across their products. The example above is from LiveRamp, which is a company that provides data to advertisers and AdTech  companies. This is a similar process to the first point, however, opting out of the Ad Tech & MarTech products will apply to  all websites that use that particular software or platform. This method works in a similar way to the first solution, except instead of creating a first-party opt-out cookie on  the publisher’s side, a third-party opt-out cookie is created on the AdTech vendor’s side. Organizations like the  NAI (mentioned below) allow users to opt out of behavioral targeting from all the members (i.e. vendors) in  their organization.",745,126,186.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2174,338,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The third-party cookie's value is then sent with every request to the participating vendors advising them that  the user has opted out and therefore shouldn't apply behavioral targeting in ads or collect behavioural data. While this method allows users to opt out from multiple companies at once, it’s up to vendors as to whether  they respect the user’s decision to opt out or not, but since it's their opt-out cookie, they generally should  uphold the user’s decision. Solution #4: Opt out of behavioral advertising via Advertising Organizations  There are a couple organizations that exist to help online users control how their data is collected and used for  activities such as behavioral targeting. The two main organizations are the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising  Alliance (DAA). 338",825,135,206.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2175,339,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is the leading self-regulatory association consisting of third-party  digital advertising companies. The NAI is a non-profit organization and aims to promote the health of the online ecosystem by maintaining  and enforcing high standards for data collection and use for advertising online and in mobile. The NAI provides a tool that allows online users to opt out of behavioral advertising. The NAI opt-out tool:  ●  Only affects behavioral advertising. ●  Opts users out of behavioral targeting from NAI members only.,559,89,139.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

2178,340,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Through its YourAdChoices initiative, the DAA offers a browser tool, known as WebChoices Tool, that allows  online users to opt out of behavioral targeting from DAA’s participating companies. Just like with the NAI opt-out solution, if a user deletes their cookies, then they will have to go through the  opt-out process again. Solution #5: Disabling third-party cookies from being saved in your web browser and activating the  Do-Not-Track feature. 340",453,73,113.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2179,341,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:You can disable third-party cookie tracking and enable the Do Not Track option in your web browser by  adjusting the privacy preferences in the web browser’s settings. The Do Not Track (DNT) option requests that a web application disable either its tracking or cross-site user  tracking of an individual user. The DNT header is automatically attached with every HTTP request that the user’s browser makes, but it's up  to the vendor receiving the request (e.g. ad server, SSP etc.)to honour it or not.

2180,342,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Implications Of Opt-Out Solutions  There are a 2 main implications opt-out solutions have on the online advertising industry:  1. Lower ROI for advertisers. The implications of opt-out solutions affects both the advertiser and publisher because if more and more users  decide to opt out of behavioral advertising, then this will devalue the publisher’s audiences & traffic and will  cause their inventory to be less valuable. For advertisers, their ROI will be impacted as their ads won’t be shown to engaged or interested users. 2.",536,89,134.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2181,342,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Lower revenue for publishers and less opportunities to monetize the Internet. Currently, publishers and app developers display ads as a way to monetize their content and apps, most of  which are provided for free. The increase in opt outs will result in publishers and app developers charging for  their content and apps. There are quite a few publishers, mainly large news sites, that already charge for their content, but this type of  monetization model could increase. Similarly, app developers could start charging for their apps, which could  lead to a decrease in free apps available to users.",600,101,150.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2182,342,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Differing Views on Data Collection  There are many different views and opinions on the way users’ data is collected, shared, and sold online. Some believe that if the tracking is only for advertising purposes, it poses no great risk to their privacy, while  others believe that it is a clear violation of their privacy and will go out of their way to prevent companies from  tracking their online movements. Online privacy is a hot topic, especially since the NSA scandal broke in 2013 , and with more and more users  going online, the opportunities for companies to target them with their ads is only going to increase. But regardless of your own view on data collection, it is an area of online display advertising that has many  challenges to overcome, both from the business side and from the user side.

Too Many or Annoying Ads  One of the main reasons why users install ad blockers is because they are shown too many ads, which often  has a negative impact on the user experience. 343",343,64,85.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2184,344,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This webpage has 3 ads above the fold (the top visible area of the page). In additional to traditional banner ads, many websites also have pop-up ups, which are considered the most  annoying type of ad as they tend to take up the whole page, stop the user from doing what they were doing  (e.g. reading an article), and often require the user to click a small cross to close the ad. Adware  Adware is a form of software that downloads or displays unwanted ads when a user is online, collects  marketing data and other information without the user's knowledge or redirects search requests to certain  advertising websites. Adware that does not notify the user and attains his or her consent is regarded as malicious. Adware is the name given to programs that are designed to display advertisements on your computer, redirect  your search requests to advertising websites, and collect marketing-type data about you – for example, the  types of websites that you visit – so that customized adverts can be displayed.",1012,179,253.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Sometimes there will be no signs of the program in your computer’s system and no indication in your program  menu that files have been installed on your machine. There are two main ways in which Adware can get onto your computer:  Via freeware or shareware : Adware can be included within some freeware or shareware programs as a  legitimate way of generating advertising revenues that help to fund the development and distribution of the  freeware or shareware program.

AdTech From The Vendors’ And Agencies’  Perspective  So far in this book we’ve mainly been focusing on technical topics and the relationship between advertisers  and publishers, but in this chapter, we’ll briefly cover the business side of AdTech and what that looks like for  technology vendors (e.g. DSPs and SSPs) and advertising agencies. 346",350,59,87.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2189,347,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:AdTech from the Vendor’s Perspective  To summarize AdTech from the vendor’s perspective, we’ll look at two main areas: AdTech business models  and the main technical challenges with running an AdTech company. AdTech Business Models  The two most common business models employed by AdTech companies are fixed CPM and a percentage of  the media cost, but many AdTech companies are switching to, or at least incorporating, the traditional usage  model found at other software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Here’s an overview of the main pricing models used by AdTech vendors today:  Business model  Description  Fixed CPM  Clients pay a fixed cost per mille for every  impression served. Percentage of media spend  Clients pay a percentage of the media cost. So if an  advertiser buys inventory at $1.50 CPM, the DSP it  uses to buy the inventory could charge 10%,  meaning the total cost of the ad for the advertiser  would be $1.65.",932,164,233.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2190,347,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:SaaS  Clients pay a set price per month based on the  number of users (aka seats). There are many variations of the SaaS pricing model  and many vendors can incorporate elements of it and  combine it with the fixed CPM and percentage of  media spend models. To read more about the above models, we recommend this article by Beewax’s co-founder and CEO, Ari  Paparo: The Entrepreneur’s Guide To Ad Tech Business Models  The Main Technical Challenges of Running an AdTech Company  Although the technical challenges AdTech companies face vary from company to company, there are a few  that all AdTech vendors would experience:  Performance and scalability: Due to the real-time and fast nature of programmatic media buying, AdTech  vendors need to ensure their platforms can handle large volumes of bid requests per second and produce  reports within a short period of time, e.g. showing analytics data within 15 minutes of the impression being  displayed. This is critically important for platforms like DSPs and SSPs that have only 100ms to conduct an  RTB auction. Keeping infrastructure and cloud computing costs down: Because many AdTech platforms handle large  volumes of traffic (e.g. ad requests and responses), it’s important for them to keep infrastructure and cloud  347",1278,220,319.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2191,348,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:computing costs down. One way to achieve this is to optimize their cloud computing architecture and select  better performing systems (e.g. databases). Finding developers with skills and experience in building AdTech platforms: Designing and building  AdTech platforms is much different than building other types of software and there’s a long and steep learning  curve attached to it. Building AdTech platforms requires understanding of how the different players and  platforms in the digital advertising ecosystem work and connect together.

The Main Technology Platforms and Intermediaries in the Digital  Advertising Ecosystem , many brands have traditionally partnered with advertising agencies to help them with  pretty much every aspect of their advertising campaigns, from creating the ads to running the campaigns  across multiple publishers. But thanks to advertising technology, some brands are taking some of the digital media-buying activities  in-house.

Below we’ll look at the three main variations of the in-house model for brands and ad agencies. 1. The Traditional Way of Buying Digital Media  In this first example, a brand uses an advertising agency for their advertising campaigns. The advertising  agency’s AdOps team would then use external AdTech platforms to execute and manage the campaigns.",495,81,123.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2194,349,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main advantage of this arrangement is that the brand can outsource all of its advertising activities to the ad  agency.

An Ad Agency Takes Programmatic Buying and AdTech In-House  In this third example, an agency has its own in-house AdOps team and its own in-house AdTech platforms. The biggest advantage of taking all aspects of programmatic buying and AdTech in-house is control and  ownership of the technology and data, which will provide the agency with transparent insights into the true cost  of its media spend and audiences.",788,131,197.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2195,349,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main disadvantages of this setup would be costs. Building AdTech platforms requires a big financial  investment in the beginning and then an ongoing investment to maintain the AdTech platforms. Therefore, this sort of situation is mainly reserved for large agencies whose revenues from media campaigns  are enough to justify the large financial investments in building and maintaining AdTech platforms. 349",410,63,102.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2196,350,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:3. A Brand Takes Programmatic Buying In-House  In this example, a brand bypasses the ad agency and uses an in-house AdOps team and external AdTech  platforms. For brands, there are a number of advantages of taking programmatic media buying in-house. The main ones  being cost savings as the brand doesn’t have to pay an ad agency, and more control over their data, ad  placements, and audience relationships. However, bypassing an ad agency means that brands miss out on some of the most critical parts of any  successful ad campaign like brand development, advanced marketing tactics and methods, and large amounts  of creativity, which are all provided by ad agencies.",670,115,167.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Just like in the example above, one major drawback is the absence of creativity and experience that’s provided  by ad agencies. The main advantages of in-house programmatic and AdTech for brands are control, transparency, and cost  savings. By using their own AdOps team and AdTech platforms, brands will have much more control over their data and  relationships with their supply-side partners and publishers, and have greater transparency into the  350",597,97,149.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Also, if a brand doesn’t spend enough on media,  then they might not have any long-term cost savings at all.

Programmatic & AdTech in 2022: Challenges and  Opportunities  Throughout this book, we’ve explained how many different areas of programmatic advertising and AdTech  work. In this chapter, we’ll list the main challenges and opportunities in the web, in-app mobile, CTV and OTT, and  DOOH industries. The Main Challenges and Opportunities in Web Advertising  Identity and Privacy  In programmatic advertising, identity refers to the process of identifying individual users across different  websites, mobile apps, or other devices. 352",537,84,134.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2204,353,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Identity powers many key AdTech processes, including:  ● Behavioral targeting  ● Retargeting  ● Frequency capping  ● Measurement  ● Attribution  ● Ad fraud detection  The Challenges  For the past decade, third-party cookies have been the main mechanism for identifying online visitors in web  browsers, but this is changing fast. Over the past few years, there’s been a big movement towards strengthening online user privacy. And in digital advertising, strengthening user privacy typically means making it harder for companies to identify  individuals across different websites, mobile apps, and devices. We’ve seen the introduction of privacy laws like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as well as many other privacy laws in other  countries. We’ve also seen many popular web browsers strengthen privacy for their users by limiting or blocking  identification methods.",948,151,237.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Chrome then  announced in June 2021 that it won’t be shutting off third-party cookies until 2023. When Google Chrome finally does pull the pin on third-party cookies, it will have a much bigger impact on  programmatic advertising than Safari and Firefox have had so far because of Chrome’s global market share. 353",506,85,126.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2206,354,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The changes made by Safari and Firefox have given the programmatic advertising industry a preview of what a  world without third-party cookies looks like, and it’s not pretty. For the most part, publishers have seen CPMs decrease and advertisers have noticed their addressable  audiences shrink. In 2022, all players in the programmatic advertising industry, from advertisers and agencies to tech vendors  and publishers, will need to evaluate their identity strategies and look for solutions that solve their problems,  which may differ from one company to another. Opportunities  For most companies, the opportunities will come in the form of solutions already available on the market. For  others, there are opportunities to innovate and build new tech to power the future of identity or meet their  business goals.",818,133,204.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2207,355,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Advertisers and agencies  In the past, advertisers and agencies have utilized third-party data to expand the size of their addressable  audiences and reach more of their target audiences. The privacy changes mentioned above have reduced the availability of third-party data, leaving advertisers and  agencies looking for new ways to reach their audiences. Here are just some ways advertisers and agencies can navigate the identity challenges in 2022:  First-party data: Most brands collect a treasure trove of first-party data, whether it’s from their website, mobile  apps, CRM platforms, ecommerce tools, or offline systems. But simply collecting this data isn’t enough. Advertisers and agencies will need to activate it, and one way they  can do this is via an ID resolution service.",786,126,196.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2208,355,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:ID resolution services and ID graphs: Although some advertisers are moving away from behavioral targeting  and towards other targeting methods, such as contextual, there are many that still see more value in being  able to identify members of their audience across different websites and devices. But with the availability of third-party cookies declining and mobile IDs facing a similar fate (at least, Apple’s  IDFA for now), advertisers will have to utilize a new set of tools to run identification, targeting, and attribution. And ID resolution services and ID graphs are good options to explore. ID resolution services and ID graphs aim to piece together IDs from online and offline channels to create a  centralized view of consumers that can identify them across different websites, apps, and devices. From there, advertisers can run behavioral targeting, retargeting, frequency capping, measurement, and  attribution.",925,145,231.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2209,355,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Contextual targeting: There’s been a lot of talk in the programmatic industry about the revival of contextual  targeting. Even though some advertisers won’t see the same campaign performance from contextual targeting as they do  from other targeting methods like behavioral or retargeting, others may find that this type of targeting is more  effective. Because of its revived popularity, advertisers can expect to see more tools and options for contextual targeting  in 2022 and beyond. Tech vendors  For tech companies, the challenges around privacy have brought about platform consolidation, thrown up all  kinds of obstacles, and threatened their business models. But despite the challenges, tech companies actually stand to benefit the most from the current situation.",773,121,193.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf

Below are just some opportunities that tech vendors can take advantage of:  Build identity resolution services: Although there are already a number of ID resolution services and ID  graphs on the market, there are some AdTech and MarTech vendors that could benefit from building their own  ID tools and solutions and incorporating them into their current product offerings. Build or update existing tech: The changing programmatic industry requires tech companies to change their  tech.",781,127,195.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2211,356,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Whether it’s incorporating new targeting methods (e.g. contextual), integrating with other platforms and  tools, or building new tech, the successful AdTech and MarTech companies of the future focus on innovation  and solve the various challenges with new technologies. Innovation has also been a core component of programmatic advertising. We saw this with things like real-time  bidding (RTB) and we’ll see it again with the challenges around identity and privacy. Publishers  The challenges and opportunities that publishers face regarding identity and privacy are very similar to those  that advertisers face. For publishers, the fact that third-party cookies are no longer available in Safari and Firefox and will soon be  scrapped from Chrome means that they’re not able to identify their audience on the same scale as they used  to, resulting in advertisers paying lower CPMs because they’re not able to identify their target audiences.",943,150,235.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2212,356,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This has caused publishers to look for solutions that will enable them to continue identifying their audiences, or  at least part of their audience, and bolster their monetization strategies. First-party data: Out of all of the players in the programmatic advertising industry, publishers are the only  ones that have direct access to the most prized asset of all; audiences. Sure, some advertisers also function as publishers and have access to audiences, but publishers are the ones  that hold the key to the castle. The ever-growing challenges around privacy and identity have led publishers to focus on creating stronger  relationships with their audiences and unlocking the potential of their first-party data. Luckily for publishers, many AdTech and MarTech companies have also turned their focus to helping  publishers unlock the value of their first-party data.",869,138,217.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2213,356,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Examples include:  ● The Trade Desk’s Unified ID 2.0 . ● Independent identity providers like ID5 . ● ID resolution services and ID graphs like LiveRamp , Tapad , Signal , Zeotap , and InfoSum . 356",197,38,49.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2214,357,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Tech development investments: Traditionally, many publishers haven’t seen the need to invest in tech  development, but the privacy and identity challenges are providing publishers with the opportunity to not only  solve these challenges via tech development, but also give them more control over their audiences and data. In 2021, we saw many large publishers invest in tech development, and in 2022, we’ll likely see an increase in  publishers entering this space. The New York Times, for example, has built its own audience segments that it offers to advertisers. By building  out these audience segments based on its rich first-party data, it has taken ownership of its audience and  provided a solution to a problem that is usually handled by tech companies. While building new tech and tools, or even a small amount of custom tech development, won’t suit every  publisher, there are certainly many publishers that stand to benefit by making technology development a part of  their monetization and growth strategy for 2022.",1028,170,257.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2215,357,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  There’s also another solution that publishers, advertisers, ad agencies, and AdTech companies can explore;  Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox. Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox is a series of standards and APIs designed to replace the processes currently  underpinned by third-party cookies. The goal of Privacy Sandbox is to maintain targeted advertising and measurement for both advertisers and  publishers, but do it in a much more privacy-friendly way. Privacy Sandbox is currently being worked on in a W3C business group between Google Chrome, Google’s ad  product teams, and independent AdTech companies, publishers, advertisers, and agencies. Although some of  the standards have been tested, it’s not yet known when Privacy Sandbox will go live.",775,119,193.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2216,357,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The Main Challenges and Opportunities in In-App Mobile Advertising  The mobile advertising industry has been on a constant incline over the past 5-10 years, but in 2022, the  industry will face challenges it hasn’t faced before. Challenges  Apple’s Privacy Changes  Traditionally, Apple’s privacy crusade has been isolated to its Safari web browser, but in June 2020 at the  Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the tech giant announced a series of privacy changes to its  upcoming release of iOS 14 that will have a negative impact on in-app mobile advertising. Here’s an overview of the privacy changes in iOS 14:  Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)  Apple announced that it will be releasing a new feature in its mobile devices known as the  AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) framework. 357",799,133,199.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2217,358,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This feature will require app developers to obtain permission from users before collecting the device’s identifier  for advertisers (IDFA) and passing it to AdTech companies, such as ad networks, supply-side platforms  (SSPs), and mobile measurement platforms (MMPs). Apple’s IDFA is a string of random numbers and letters assigned to Apple devices like iPhones, iPad, and  Apple TVs. Advertisers can use the IDFA to identify iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS users across different apps to deliver  personalized and targeted advertising, run frequency capping, measure campaign performance, and attribute  impressions and clicks to app installs. Here’s an example of what an IDFA could look like:  7D902I08D-7846-4CA4-TE6P-83369125YFDC  A device’s IDFA can be accessed by the app’s developer and then passed on to different AdTech platforms. However, Apple’s changes to its IDFA means that before a device’s IDFA can be accessed by a mobile app  developer, they’ll first need to get consent from the user using the ATT framework.",1018,162,254.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2218,358,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Users will be shown a message similar to the one below and asked to make a choice:  If the user selects the Allow Tracking options, then the IDFA will be passed as usual. If the user doesn’t allow  the app developer to access their IDFA, i.e. selects Ask App Not to Track, then the IDFA will be zeroed out,  making it useless from an identification point of view. 358",367,72,91.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2219,359,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The mobile app developer will only be able to ask the user for access to their IDFA once per install. Nobody knows for sure but most estimates put the opt-in rate between 1% to 20%. Tim Koschella, CEO at Kayzan, posted some figures that show the initial opt-in rates were around 15% to 20%. However, it’s still early days and the opt-in rates will depend on a number of factors, such as the vertical  (gaming vs dating) and whether app developers have displayed their own message to users before showing  them the ATT message. As you can imagine, it’s likely that most users will select the Ask App Not to Track option, meaning the IDFA  won’t be as readily available as it is now.",681,127,170.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2220,359,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:This will have a negative impact on the performance of in-app mobile  advertising campaigns as ad targeting and attribution will be less accurate. We’ve already seen companies like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter reportedly post losses totalling $10 billion  USD as a result of Apple’s IDFA changes. Many other companies operating in the in-app advertising industry  would have also seen their revenues fall. We’ll likely see similar stories emerge in 2022. Apple’s SKAdNetwork  Although Apple hasn’t offered up any kind of solution for ad targeting, it has proposed a tool for attributing ad  clicks to add installs.",616,101,154.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2221,359,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:And it’s called SKAdNetwork. Apple’s SKAdNetwork is designed to provide advertisers with conversion data without revealing any user-level  or device-level data. It’s Apple’s version of a privacy-friendly way to attribute app installs. Here’s how Apple’s SKAdNetwork will work:  359,281,41,70.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2222,360,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:A couple of points about the SKAdNetwork:  ● The IDFA won’t be passed to AdTech platforms or MMPs, even if the user has opted in. ● All attribution data will pass through SKAdNetwork and then onto the AdTech platform or MMP. ● SKAdNetwork will only attribute app installs (via the last-click model) and not view-through conversions. ● Campaign IDs are limited to 100 per AdTech platform (e.g. ad network or MMP). Privacy Report and ITP for All Browsers in iOS 14, iPad 14, and Safari 14  In addition to the AppTrackingTransparency framework, Apple also announced a couple other privacy changes  in iOS 14 :  1.",610,109,152.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2223,360,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Privacy Report: Users will now be able to see how many trackers were blocked by Safari on a given  page, as well as other information about trackers. 2. ITP for all web browsers: For iOS 14 users, ITP will be applied to all web browsers, not only Safari. This means that all web browsers, not just Safari, in iOS (v14 and above) will include the Intelligent Tracking  Prevention feature. 360",391,72,97.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2224,361,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:WWGD = What Will Google Do? Ever since Apple announced its changes to its IDFA, many people in the industry asked the question, “Will  Google make changes to its mobile ID?” In May 2021, Google announced that it will require app developers to include privacy information in their  Google Play Store listings, similar to the privacy information displayed in Apple’s App Store listings. Then in July 2021, Google announced that it would stop passing on its AAID if the user had opted out of  personalized advertising. These changes went live with the release of Android 12 in the later part of 2021.",597,105,149.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2225,361,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:While this is considered a privacy change, it’s not as stringent as the ones released by Apple. Opportunities  Just like with the privacy challenges in web browsers, the main opportunity here for companies is to create  solutions that will allow advertisers to reach their target audience and measure the performance of their ad  campaigns, and help mobile app developers to continue their app monetization strategies via advertising. But this won’t be easy, and in some ways it will be harder to solve the IDFA challenges than it will be to solve  the third-party cookies challenges in web browsers. The Main Challenges and Opportunities in CTV and OTT  The hype around the connected TV (CTV) and over-the-top (OTT) industries is akin to the hype around mobile  in the late 2000s. There’s a lot happening in the CTV and OTT worlds, and just like all new channels, they are experiencing a  few teething problems.",912,159,228.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2226,361,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Challenges  The main challenges in the CTV and OTT advertising industries are:  Fragmentation  Unlike the fragmentation of tech platforms and devices that we’re used to seeing, the fragmentation issue in  CTV and OTT runs much deeper. Firstly, every CTV device has its own hardware and software, meaning they all have their own IDs (some don’t  have any!). This makes it difficult to create any kind of unified identifier across all of the different CTV devices. Also, the fact that a consumer might use multiple devices to watch video content across different OTT services  only exacerbates the problem. What this means for advertisers is that it’s quite hard to reach their target  audience at scale within the CTV and OTT environments.",738,127,184.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2227,362,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Compare this to advertising in web browsers. If an advertiser wanted to reach their target audience, then the  only real challenge would be identifying them across different browsers (ignoring for a moment the various  privacy challenges around identity in web browsers). Even though there are many web browsers available, most people use Google Chrome and don’t tend to  switch between web browsers. In the CTV and OTT environments, there are multiple CTV devices and multiple OTT apps, meaning identifying  audiences across all of those devices and apps is a huge challenge. To help alleviate these identity challenges, the IAB Tech Lab has released a set of guidelines to help  companies operating in the CTV and OTT industry use and pass the correct ID from the various devices to  OTT apps and AdTech platforms.",816,139,204.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2228,362,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Measurement  The key to accurate measurement and attribution in digital advertising is identity. And as you saw above, there  are many challenges around identity. In the short term, this means measuring the performance of CTV and  OTT campaigns and attributing ad views to conversions will be limited at best. When it comes to viewability and measurement, there are a few key challenges that need to be addressed:  ● Identifiers: The lack of a consistent identifier across all the different CTV devices means that  identification is fragmented and limited. ● Access to devices: Most CTV devices are closed off, meaning third-party verification tools have  restricted access.",674,111,168.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2229,362,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:● Server-side ad insertion: Server-side ad insertion is a common way to serve ads inside CTV and OTT  environments, but it presents many challenges (listed in the next section). Because of the way SSAI is  set up, it is harder to identify invalid traffic (IVT) and collect measurement data. To help address these key challenges, the IAB has been working on refining some of its existing standards,  specifically, VAST and OM. The video ad serving template (VAST) is an IAB standard that is used in video advertising in both web browser  and in-app mobile environments. Although VAST is responsible for video ad serving, it doesn’t handle the  measurement side of video advertising.",681,117,170.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2230,362,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:For that, there’s video Video Player Ad Interface Definition (VPAID) . However, VPAID will soon be depreciated and the measurement function of VPAID will be replaced with the  open measurement (OM) standard. The goal of OM is to not only power measurement for video advertising in web browser and in-app mobile  environments, but also in CTV and OTT environments. The IAB is continually working on both VAST and OM to help standardize the ad serving and measurement  processes within the CTV and OTT environments. 362",517,88,129.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2231,363,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Ad Serving  Server-side ad insertion is becoming the main way to serve ads in CTV and OTT environments. Although SSAI  is an improvement on CSAI, it does have a couple of drawbacks. For starters, it’s vulnerable to ad fraud as it’s not easy to identify if the ad requests are coming from an actual  AdTech platform or whether there’s a fraudster on the other end. Because of this, it is also hard for invalid  traffic detection tools to tell the difference between genuine and fake traffic. Secondly, it’s harder to incorporate IAB standards, such as VPAID and older VAST versions, into SSAI.",592,106,148.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2232,363,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:But as mentioned above, the IAB Tech Lab is working on updating the existing video ad-serving standards  VAST and OM to support ad serving and measurement. Ad Fraud  Ad fraud has been a constant challenge in programmatic advertising for the best part of a decade, with  fraudsters following the money; from display to mobile, and now, to CTV and OTT. Just like with other channels, fraudsters have been looking for the vulnerabilities and opacity to carry out and  conceal their fraudulent activities. Some of the main CTV and OTT ad fraud schemes that have been detected so far include ParrotTerra ,  StreamScam , LeoTerra, Colorius, ICEBUCKET , DiCaprio , and Monarch . The fact that the CTV and OTT industry is still fairly new, it’s not really surprising that we’ve seen so many ad  fraud schemes already.",809,143,202.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2233,363,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:As the industry matures, we’ll likely see more IAB standards like app-ads.txt be adopted, which will help  address and hopefully eradicate some of the ad fraud schemes listed above. But as we’ve seen in other digital advertising channels, ad fraud is a constant theme that is difficult to eliminate  completely. Opportunities  The main opportunity here is to address and solve these challenges via technical innovation. Out-Of-Home (DOOH)  Challenges  The main challenge facing the out-of-home (DOOH) industry is returning to the pre-pandemic levels of both ad  spend and investment in technology. Prior to the COVID19 outbreak, the OOH industry was one the fastest growing digital advertising industries,  with most of this growth originating from digital out-of-home (DOOH).",776,123,194.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2234,364,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:When most cities around the world went into lockdown, the OOH market was one of the hardest hit. According to research from eMarketer conducted before March 2020, ad spend on OOH in the US was set to  grow by 3.3% in 2020, with ad spend totalling US$8.87 billion. Adjusted forecasts in June 2020 put the total ad  spend for 2020 at US$8.25 billion. In the UK, a report by the Advertising Association and Warc showed that ad spend on OOH fell by 70.4% in the  second quarter of 2020 . Apart from the impact of the pandemic, other challenges in the DOOH industry revolve around inventory  availability, audience targeting, and measurement and attribution.",653,117,163.25,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2235,364,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Opportunities  The opportunities in DOOH lie in solving the many technical challenges the industry faces. The addition of the digital, and programmatic, element of out-of-home means that companies need to invest in  developing the technology that will allow DOOH to mirror the other digital forms of advertising, such as display  and in-app mobile. But this is challenging, mainly because it’s much harder to set up a DOOH ad campaign than it is to set up a  traditional display ad campaign. However, as more investment goes into DOOH, the gap between what’s  possible currently with DOOH and what isn’t will decrease. Another Topic to Keep an Eye on in 2022  The topic below isn’t a challenge, but rather an industry trend that we’ll likely see more of throughout 2022.",770,134,192.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2236,364,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Antitrust investigations and Lawsuits Against GAFA  Over the past year or so, we’ve seen a number of governments around the world take aim at the dominance of  Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple in the form of antitrust investigations. This is an area worth keeping an eye on as it may lead to some of the walled gardens spinning off some of  their products and companies, which may impact independent AdTech companies and the programmatic  advertising industry (likely, in a positive way). Below are the main antitrust investigations that have began so far:  The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority Investigates Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  On January 8, 2021, the UK’s competition watchdog opened an investigation into Google’s intent to eliminate  third-party cookies and other functions from Chrome browser that would negatively affect the advertising and  marketing industry. 364",892,145,223.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2237,365,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Online Publishers Sue Google in Advertising Antitrust Lawsuit  On Wednesday October 20, 2020, Genius Media Group together with The Nation put forward a lawsuit seeking  justice over Google, claiming that it has hurt their businesses by controlling advertising opponents and  displaying anticompetitive conduct. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) Investigates Google  On Tuesday October 20, 2020, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an investigation into Google’s  dominance of its search and search advertising businesses. A Bipartisan Group of State Attorneys General Sue Google  In December 2020, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general from 38 states sued Google for  anticompetitive conduct relating to its search and search advertising businesses. The lawsuit is very similar to the DOJ’s lawsuit (listed above) but provides more examples of Google’s  anticompetitive behavior to secure the dominance of its services (e.g. search engine and mobile apps). Republican Attorneys from 10 States Sue Google Over Anticompetitive Behavior in the Digital  Advertising Market  On Wednesday December 16, 2020, the Republican attorneys from 10 states sued Google for its dominance  of the digital advertising market.",1222,189,305.5,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2238,365,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:The main allegations are that Google overcharged advertisers, boxed out competitors and squeezed  publishers, adding up a monopoly tax on businesses. The FTC and Attorneys General Sue Facebook Over Illegal Monopolization of the Social Networking  Market  On Wednesday December 9, 2020, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 48 attorneys general sued  Facebook for alleged illegal monopolization of the social networking market. Although both of these lawsuits are separate, they were both announced at the same time and concern the  same topic; Facebook’s violation of antitrust laws. The Australian Government Introduces a New Media Bargaining Code to Make Google and Facebook  Pay for Distributing News  While most governments are opening antitrust investigations into Google and Facebook, the Australian  government has decided to tackle the duolpolgy’s dominance in a different way. In December 2017, the Australian Government asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  (ACCC) to open an inquiry into Google and Facebook to determine the impact those companies have on  competition in the media and advertising markets in Australia.",1155,179,288.75,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
2239,365,"adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf:Then in July 2019, the ACCC released the final report and executive summary. For the most part, the code  would require Google and Facebook to negotiate deals with media companies whereby the tech giants would  pay them for the content they distribute. 365",256,45,64.0,adtech/The AdTech Book.pdf
