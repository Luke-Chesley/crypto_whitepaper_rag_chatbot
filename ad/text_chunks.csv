16,0,"01. Introduction  If you were to peel back the curtains on the ads you see on websites and mobile apps, you would be amazed  at what’s happening behind the scenes. The online advertising ecosystem consists of companies, technology  systems, and complex technical processes all working together to serve ads to online users across the  Internet. Online advertising has brought with it a number of positives. For one, it’s provided content creators with a  source of revenue so they can distribute their content for free to online users.",535,92,133.75
17,1,"However, while the online advertising industry has experienced a number of ups, there have also been many  downs. Some key examples include being hit hard by the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s/early 2000s, and  more recently, the introduction of privacy laws (e.g. the GDPR) and privacy settings in browsers (e.g. Safari’s  Intelligent Track Prevention) that have negatively impacted advertisers, AdTech companies, and publishers. Why Have We Written This Book? Throughout our 12+ years of designing and building advertising and marketing technology, we’ve noticed 2  things:  1. The platforms and processes that make up AdTech are highly complex.",649,103,162.25
18,1,2. There are very few resources out there that explain in an easy-to-understand and transparent way how  online advertising works from both a fundamental and technical perspective. It came to our attention that we were essentially sitting on a gold mine of knowledge that we could share with  others. And thus the idea of The AdTech Book was created. Who Is The AdTech Bible Written For?,387,68,96.75
19,1,"The AdTech Book is ideal for anyone wanting to learn about the history of online advertising and understand  how the different elements of the digital advertising technology ecosystem work, what their roles are, and the  relationships between different parties in the industry. Even though the book contains a lot of highly technical and detailed explanations, we’ve tried to write the  AdTech Book in the most straightforward way possible so that anyone can read and understand the contents of  the book. More specifically, the book will greatly benefit:  ● C-level executives and founders at advertising and marketing companies. ● Advertisers and marketers who work in-house or at advertising and digital agencies. ● Programmers and technical teams that build advertising and marketing technology.",799,126,199.75
20,1,"● Publishers and content creators who monetize (or want to) their content with advertising. ● Regular, everyday web surfers who want to learn how online advertising works. General Assumptions  This book assumes that you grasp the concept of how ads are used to monetize websites and promote  products and services. This book does not assume that you have any kind of technical knowledge of how the  platforms and processes work, however if you do, then you will find that it is a lot easier to understand the  technical explanations covered throughout the book. 8",563,98,140.75
21,2,"How This Book Is Organized  The first few chapters of the book introduce the history of online advertising and set the scene for the  subsequent chapters. We cover the fundamentals of digital advertising and then slowly start to introduce the  platforms, intermediaries, and technical processes. Conventions Used In This Book  Bold  Highlights certain terms. Brand awareness (aka branding): The main goal is to reach a broad consumer audience, engage with  them, and maximize the time they are exposed to the brand. Italics  Used to highlight a specific term in a sentence, e.g:  A publisher can be defined as any company that produces content that attracts an audience.",670,115,167.5

Technical Illustrations, Explanations, And Examples  Throughout this book, whenever we illustrate, explain, or provide an example of a technical aspect (e.g. a  process such as server-side video header bidding) we are doing so in the most common or straightforward way  possible in order to avoid the concept being lost in a sea of confusion. It’s also worth noting that there is often more than one way to carry out the technical processes mentioned in  this book. 10",633,110,158.25
25,4,"An illustration about how server-side video header bidding works. Terminology Used In The Book  You’ll notice that in this book we refer to the same thing by different names. For example:  Inventory , also known as ad space or online media , is the available space a publisher has on its site or app. This is common within the online advertising industry, but to avoid confusion, we will aim to only use one term  throughout the book. The only exception to this are the terms online advertising and digital advertising .",520,94,130.0
26,4,"Although these terms are not  synonymous with one another, we’ll use both terms sparingly throughout the book to refer to the same thing —  advertising delivered and displayed on the Internet or digital devices.

28,6,"02. Advertising basics  The Advertiser-Publisher Relationship  Digital advertising is a global multibillion-dollar industry comprising thousands of companies, but at the heart of  it all are two key players: the advertiser and the publisher . The advertiser-publisher relationship dates back well before the invention of the internet. Publishers, such as  newspapers and magazines, would sell ad space to advertisers as a way to generate additional revenue on top  of their regular subscriptions and individual sales. 13",520,80,130.0
29,7,"Nowadays anyone can become a publisher by simply creating a website or developing a mobile app and  selling ad space to advertisers. This has completely changed the dynamics of the traditional  advertiser-publisher relationship. What is an Advertiser? An advertiser is a brand or company (e.g. advertising agency) that wants to get its product or service in front  of its target audience to build brand awareness, develop brand loyalty, and increase sales. Below are some examples of brands that spend billions of dollars ($USD) per year on advertising:  Advertisers aren’t only big brands, however; millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and  organizations advertise their services and products online every day.",729,115,182.25
30,7,"Large brands, such as those listed above, are often represented by advertising agencies , whose job it is to:  Create the campaign : Designing the graphical elements and message of the ad. Execute the campaign : Configuring the campaign (e.g. setting up targeting and frequency capping) and  launching it across different channels (e.g. web, in-app, and DOOH). Manage the campaign: Measuring campaign results and making changes to improve performance. A brief history of advertising agencies  The first agencies date back as far as 1786 when William Taylor opened his office in London, today  acknowledged as the first advertising agency in history. 14",652,106,163.0
31,8,"However, while the UK business is considered the precursor of advertising agencies in Europe, it was Volney  B. Palmer who took the idea across the ocean, opening the first agency on American soil in Philadelphia in  1842. Volney would buy large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate, then resell the space  at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad, including the copy, layout, and artwork, was prepared by the  client, which basically made Palmer an ad-space broker with little influence on the creative side. Some agents, at the request of their clients, created directories with advertising rates of newspapers in New  England. Many agencies made a profit buying newspaper space and reselling it with a markup.",740,125,185.0
32,8,"Many other advertising agencies soon followed the same business model until the 19th century when N. W.  Ayer & Son was founded in New York. The agency, rather than simply selling space, provided a full range of services, including planning, creating,  and executing complete campaigns for its customers. It made itself famous working for clients such as De Beers, AT&T, and the U. S. Army, creating a number of  memorable slogans. We talk more about ad agencies in Chapter 04: The Main Technology Platforms and Intermediaries in the  Digital Advertising Ecosystem  Source: Adland: A Global History of Advertising, published by Kogan Page; Second edition (July 28, 2013)  Throughout this book, you’ll see us use the term advertiser , which can either refer to an advertiser working  in-house at a brand, or an ad agency working on behalf of a brand. Why Do Brands and Companies Advertise?",888,153,222.0
33,8,"There are a number of reasons why brands and companies advertise. Below are some of the main advertising  strategies:  Brand awareness: Reach a broad consumer audience, engage with them, and maximize the time they are  exposed to the brand. Direct response (aka prospecting, acquisition): Generate new leads, sales, and conversions by displaying  ads that persuade the consumer to take some sort of action, such as fill in a form. Retention : Re-engage with existing customers and consumers who have previously interacted or been  exposed to a brand, which is very often conducted via retargeting (aka remarketing) campaigns. What is a Publisher?",646,106,161.5
34,8,"A publisher can be defined as any company that produces content that attracts an audience. Examples of publishers include newspapers and magazines in the offline world, and websites and mobile apps  in the online world. 15",222,37,55.5
35,9,"Above are examples of publishers displayed on different devices. Notice how they all have an ad displayed? The term publisher doesn’t solely refer to websites, it can also extend to content or publishing platforms, such  as YouTube, Facebook, and Hulu. How Do Publishers Monetize Their Websites and Apps? There are a number of ways publishers can monetize their websites or apps depending on their strategy.",407,66,101.75
36,10,"This is by far one of the most popular ways to monetize websites and apps of all shapes and sizes. Depending  on the pricing model, publishers can either make money each time a visitor clicks on an ad or for every 1,000  impressions. See chapter 05. The Main Digital Advertising Mediums and Channels for more information about the  different types of digital advertisements. Paywalls and Registration Walls  17",410,72,102.5
37,11,"Many popular news and premium-content sites hide their content behind paywalls and registration walls. Paywalls: Require users to either buy a subscription or pay a one-time fee to access the content. News and media companies are increasingly implementing paywalls as a way to make up for the financial  losses they’ve experienced as a result of ad blockers. Registration walls: Require users to create a free account, or simply provide their email address in order to  access the content. Registration walls allow publishers to collect first-party data and build addressable audiences.",586,92,146.5
38,11,"Publishers can then offer these audiences to advertisers, which can be used for ad targeting. However, this  method is still susceptible to ad blockers. Products and Services  18",178,30,44.5
39,12,"There are some publishers that monetize their websites by either selling their own products and services or by  partnering with other companies and promoting their products and services, for which they would receive a  commission or percentage of the revenue. Examples include e-commerce stores, affiliate sites, industry-research companies, and sites that offer other  premium content and digital goods. Selling Data  19",421,65,105.25
40,13,"Large publishers with access to thousands of data sets and user profiles are able to sell the information to data  brokers or directly to advertisers. Now that we’ve defined the two most important players in the online-advertising ecosystem, it’s time to embark  on our journey through the online-advertising world, starting with a brief introduction about the technology that  powers it all. What is Advertising Technology (AdTech)? The way in which online advertising campaigns are run in today’s digital world look completely different to how  campaigns were run over the past 150+ years of advertising. It’s all thanks to the rise of advertising technology, which has transformed the way media buyers manage,  measure, and optimize online advertising campaigns.",765,122,191.25
41,13,"Advertising technology (also written as Ad Tech, AdTech, adtech, ad tech, ad technology) refers to the  software and tools used to create, run, manage, measure, and optimize digital advertising campaigns. All parties involved in digital advertising—from brands and advertisers to ad agencies, technology vendors, and  publishers—use one or more pieces of advertising technology. Since the very first pieces of AdTech were introduced in the mid-1990s, a number of new systems have  emerged to solve various problems and capitalize on new opportunities that have risen along the way. AdTech has revolutionized the way brands connect with their audiences and helped both sides get what they  want and need:  Advertisers: Want successful ad campaigns targeted at highly engaged and valued audiences with  measurable results. Publishers: Want high percentages of ad inventory sold at the highest possible price with minimal overhead  costs.",935,146,233.75
42,14,"In the image above, the advertiser (The Energy Drink Co.) pays to have its ads displayed on the publisher’s  website (Daily News). In essence, this has always been the goal of advertising, but the popularization of the Internet and introduction  of AdTech added new channels, mediums, and scale, among other things, to the entire process. For example, instead of a brand or ad agency in Chicago calling up the Chicago Tribune and placing an order  for a full-page ad in the Sunday edition with the intention of reaching Chicagoans, the brand could now buy ad  space on multiple publishers’ websites and only display ads to people from Chicago that would potentially be  interested in buying the advertiser’s product or service. These visitors would match the advertiser’s ideal target-customer profile (aka target audience), made up of a  range of criteria, such as demographics, interests, behaviors, recent purchases, and web history. The advertiser would also want to reach its desired audience at the right time, at the right place, and on the  right device—for example, during business hours at home on a laptop, or late-night in a city center on a mobile  device.",1169,199,292.25
43,14,"<em>We talk more about ad agencies in <a  href=""https://adtechbook.clearcode.cc/adtech-platforms-and-intermediaries/"" target=""_blank"">chapter 04: The  Main Technology Platforms and Intermediaries in the Digital Advertising Ecosystem</a></em>  21",245,26,61.25
44,15,"What is a target audience? A target audience is a group of consumers who are the best fit for potential buyers of an advertiser’s  product or service. They are typically characterized with certain needs or desires. Usually, the target audience can be based on a combination of demographics, interests, and/or behaviors  of the consumers. It’s not only the medium that has changed, but the actual media-buying and selling process has also adapted  to the online world.",467,79,116.75
45,15,"Back when brands would advertise in newspapers and magazines, the brand’s advertisers would contact the  newspaper’s sales team directly and purchase available ad space. Nowadays, most online media is bought and sold with the use of advertising technology, but it is responsible  for more than just moving an ad from an advertiser to a publisher. Here’s a list of just some of the things AdTech is responsible for:  ● Making decisions about which ads to display to a specific group of users based on the advertiser’s  targeting criteria. ● Delivering online media (ads) across different channels (web and in-app mobile) and devices  (smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc.). ● Optimizing campaign performance for advertisers and yield for publishers.",747,121,186.75
46,15,"● Collecting data about users and creating audiences. ● Producing measurement and analytics reports. ● Billing and media-buying process management. In chapter 04. The Main Technology Platforms and Intermediaries in the Online Display Advertising  Ecosystem , we take a closer look at how the different AdTech platforms work and the role they play in digital  advertising.",371,58,92.75
47,15,"Important Terms Explained  One of the main things you’ll discover by reading this book, if you haven’t already, is that the online advertising  industry has its own terminology and an endless supply of initialisms. We’ll now take a look at some of the most important terms that you’ll come across throughout this book, but  you can also check out our AdTech Glossary for an extensive list of advertising technology terminology. // We’ll now take a look at some of the most important terms that you’ll come across throughout this book, but  you can also check out our AdTech Glossary located at the end of this book for an extensive list of advertising  technology terminology. Ad Slot  22",688,123,172.0
48,16,"An ad slot refers to the actual space on a website that is filled with ads. You can think of this as a dedicated  part of a website for displaying ads. In an ad slot there is an ad tag that communicates with the ad server to  load an actual ad . Ad Space  Ad space is the actual impression available in the ad slot. The terms ad space and ad slot are often used  interchangeably, but the main difference is that an ad slot is where the ad space is hosted.",455,96,113.75
49,17,"To help clarify this point, think about a billboard. The actual billboard would be the ad slot and the white section  inside the billboard where the ads are placed would be the ad space. Inventory  Inventory, aka ad inventory, is the name given to all the ad space available on a website. Sometimes,  inventory and ad space are used interchangeably. There are three main types of inventory: premium , remnant , and long-tail .",426,77,106.5
50,17,"Premium inventory is a publisher’s most sought-after or most-valuable inventory. It is often inventory located  on recognizable publisher sites and typically on high-traffic pages, such as a home page, or in highly visible  areas, such as at the top of a page. Remnant inventory is inventory that a publisher has been unable to sell directly to advertisers through direct  deals and other primary inventory-monetization channels. It’s basically leftover inventory publishers are willing  to sell for less than their standard price. Long-tail inventory is inventory found on small sites and blogs.",596,94,149.0
51,17,"A large chunk of this type of inventory is sold  via Google AdSense. Long-tail sites sometimes seek better monetization alternatives to AdSense, for example,  by joining affiliate programs and networks. Creative  A c reative is the file containing the actual advertisement that the user is exposed to. The most common types  of creatives are graphical files (either static or animated), video files, and audio files, and can come in many  formats, including GIF, JPEG and HTML5 (earlier Flash), as well as MOV, FLV, MP4 for video files. 24",539,93,134.75
52,18,"Examples of different types of ads. Creative Specifications  Creative specifications prepare every party in the ecosystem to receive, handle, and display the  advertisements, from ad agencies designing the creatives, to AdTech vendors delivering and measuring the  ads, through to publishers preparing their sites to display ads. These specifications have been developed by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) , an organization  designed to deliver standardization to the online advertising industry. For the most part, creative specifications:  ●  Specify dimensions, size, and file formats. For example.:",611,90,152.75
53,18,"○  300x250 pixels (dimensions). Maximum 100 KB (size). HTML5, GIF, or JPEG (file format). ●  Outline good practices. For example:  ○  The <noscript> tag should be applied, as this provides a path to an alternate image when users  have scripts disabled in their browser.",269,49,67.25
54,18,"○  LEAN principles: L ightweight, E ncrypted, A d-choice-supported, N on-invasive ads. ●  Define functional requirements, such as:  ○  Maximum animation length of 15 seconds. ○  Audio must be user initiated (i.e. they must mute/unmute the audio), with mute being the default  state. ○  Expansion is not allowed. ●  Include other technical requirements.",352,61,88.0
55,19,"○  A minimum 24 frames per second (fps). ○  Z-index guidelines to specify the content elements on a webpage. These guidelines help  publishers provide a seamless user experience by ensuring ads are displayed on the correct  CSS layer, which prevents ads and the publisher’s content (e.g. text and images) from being  displayed on top of one another. Display Ad Formats  You would have noticed already that ads shown in web browsers can come in different shapes and sizes  depending on where they are shown and on which device they are displayed (e.g. desktop or mobile). Each type of ad has its own set of formats, most of which were created by the IAB in the late 1990s/early  2000s as a way to create a standard for the industry and make it easier for advertisers and publishers to trade  media.",797,148,199.25
56,19,"Traditionally, the most popular online ad formats have been the following:  These types of ad formats were part of the universal ad package (UAP), which was used in online advertising  for most of the past decade. 26",216,39,54.0
57,20,"The above ad formats are displayed in pixels (px), however, the most recent update from the IAB has changed  these ad formats slightly. IAB New Ad Portfolio  In July 2017, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) released a finalized version of the new standard, known  as IAB Standard Ad Unit Portfolio which was the biggest update since 2002 and supersedes the universal ad  package (UAP). The Ad Unit Portfolio has been enriched with ad units allowing for each creative to adjust to a variety of screen  sizes and resolutions. The ad units now include ad sizes based on aspect ratio rather than on specific sizes in pixels, and incorporate  the LEAN Principles:  L ightweight  E ncrypted  A dChoices supported  N on-invasive ads across mobile, display, and native ad formats. 27",781,139,195.25
58,21,"The above images illustrate the difference between ads that have an aspect ratio of 1:1 and 1:2. The current  IAB ad formats consist of nine aspect ratios.

The IAB’s new ad  portfolio is based on HTML5 and also includes guidelines for augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), social  media, mobile video, emoji ad messaging, and 360-degree video ads. 28",474,81,118.5
59,22,"Impression  An impression , also sometimes referred to as an ad view , is counted every time a creative is served. It’s important to note that if a user refreshed the page and saw the exact same ad, then another new  impression would be counted. See chapter 06. Ad Serving chapter to learn more about impressions and how they are tracked. Viewable Impression  A viewable impression is a metric used to determine whether an impression was actually seen by a real  human or whether it was “seen” by a bot or hidden from the user’s view—for example, at the bottom of the  page where the user doesn’t scroll.",604,113,151.0
60,23,"Please refer to chapter 13. Ad Fraud and Viewability chapter for more information about viewability. Click  A click is counted when someone clicks on an ad, even if the person doesn’t reach the advertiser’s website,  for example, if it’s temporarily unavailable. 30",265,44,66.25
61,24,"Conversion  A conversion is counted every time a user completes a goal set by an advertiser or marketer. For example, a goal could be to get consumers to purchase a product, sign up for an online service, download  a file like an ebook, or even fill in a contact form on a landing page. The form on the left represents the goal – get visitors to download the free guide – and the graph on the right  represents the number of conversions per month (how many times the free guide was downloaded). Landing Page  A landing page is a web page that an online user “lands on” after clicking on an ad or link. Landing pages are designed to be different than the usual pages of an advertiser’s website, as they are built  with a single objective in mind — get the user to convert and complete a goal, like the ones mentioned above.",822,159,205.5
62,24,"Advertising campaigns usually direct traffic to landing pages to increase the number of conversions, especially  when it’s a direct-response or prospecting campaign. 31",168,24,42.0
63,25,"The page on the left is a dedicated landing page, as it has one common theme (programmatic media-buying  development services) and one common goal (schedule a one-on-one consultation). The page on the right is  the homepage and has a more general theme with a number of different navigation options. Effectiveness of a Campaign  Throughout this book, you will see us talk about the effectiveness of an advertising campaign . This refers to meeting the goals and objectives of the campaign, whether that be increasing the number of  conversions and sales or traffic to the advertiser’s landing page or website. Pricing Models  There are a few ways advertisers pay to show their ads on publisher sites.",700,120,175.0
64,25,"Cost Per Mille (CPM)  The CPM pricing model refers to the cost per 1,000 impressions; the word mille is Latin for one thousand. The reason we use thousands instead of individual impressions is that the price per impression is very small  compared to clicks or conversions and it would be cumbersome from an accounting perspective if the  advertiser paid $0.002 per impression. Even though the calculation in ad servers and DSPs is done on a per-impression cost (e.g. $0.002 per  impressions), the CPM formula is presented to the advertiser, publisher, or AdOps team so that’s easier for  them to calculate. 32",609,106,152.25
65,26,"Cost Per Click (CPC)  Cost per click is a pricing model used to express how much each click on an ad or link would cost the  advertiser. If an advertiser buys ad inventory from a publisher on a CPC basis of $1.10, then every time a visitor clicks on  the ad, the advertiser is charged $1.10. Cost Per Action/Acquisition (CPA)  With this model, the publisher or affiliate only receives payment from the advertiser when a user has converted  (e.g. purchased a product or filled in a lead form) as a result of viewing or clicking on an ad. This model is often  applied in affiliate networks and isn’t as popular as the CPM or CPC models. Advertisers generally choose the pricing model based on their advertising strategy.",718,133,179.5
66,26,"For example, if an  advertiser wants to gain brand awareness on a large scale, it would likely choose the CPM model. If it wanted  to increase conversions, it would probably go for either the CPM or CPA model. Did You Know? You can get estimates on current display advertising figures, including CTR, ad format performance, vertical  performance, etc.,using Google’s Display Benchmark tool.",390,65,97.5

68,27,"03. The History of Online Advertising Technology  Advertising Moves Online  It was during the early 1990s when many companies, organizations, and Internet enthusiasts started creating  the first public websites. Advertisers soon spotted the potential that this new world had to offer and began  testing uncharted waters. 34",323,51,80.75
69,28,"The year 1994 saw the first recorded example of online display advertising in the form of a banner ad, which  appeared on a website called HotWired (now wired.com). It was purchased by telecommunications giant AT&T  and used to promote its campaign titled You Will. Image on the left: The first ever banner ad by AT&T appeared on HotWired on October 27, 1994. The image on the right: AT&T’s landing page for its You Will ad campaign. Over its three-month life span, 44% of viewers clicked on the banner ad ; compare that to today, where it’s  estimated that online visitors click on about 0.02% to 2% of ads.",608,111,152.0
70,28,"What is click-through rate? (CTR)  Click-through rate (CTR) is the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times it’s  displayed. For example, if an ad had a CTR of 2%, then for every 1,000 impressions, it received 20 clicks. 35",245,46,61.25
71,29,"This was the beginning of what is now a highly lucrative trade. In the early days of online display advertising, the exchange between an advertiser and a publisher was a  direct sales process and resembled the way media had always been bought and sold. The advertiser would contact the publisher and purchase ad space on its website on a cost-per-thousand  basis, known as Cost Per Mille (CPM) , as mille means thousand in Latin. This system meant advertisers would  pay a certain price for every 1,000 impressions (i.e. 1,000 views). In order to display ads on a publisher’s website, the advertiser would send an insertion order (IO) to the  publisher’s sales team.",666,116,166.5
72,29,"The insertion order defines the terms of the campaign and includes the following:  ● Campaign objectives : Target group, traffic, branding, etc. ● Line items with campaign execution terms : Which banner sizes to use, where to place the ads, and  which pages to display the ads on. ● Business terms : The pricing model (CPM, CPC, etc.)and payment terms. Did you know?",366,65,91.5
73,29,"The terms insertion order and line items have their roots in print advertising. Orders were made for  “insertions” of the ads in newspapers and the advertiser paid a given rate per line. For example, a single  insertion of a three-line item of Business Notice in the The New York Express in 1870 cost 60 cents. Source: Pettengill’s Newspaper Directory and Advertisers’ Handbook  S. M. Pettengill & Company, 1870;  This was still a manual process that wasn’t utilizing the potential that online advertising had to offer. That all  changed when the first-ever piece of advertising technology emerged—the ad server .",613,104,153.25
74,30,"The first ad servers began popping up in 1995 and initially were used to control the delivery and management  of online ads. Back then, their targeting capabilities were very limited; they could only target ads based on the header  information that was passed along with an HTTP call from the user’s browser, such as:  ● The language set on the user’s computer  ● The URL of the page the ad is being loaded onto  ● The browser type and version  ● The user’s operating system  The first-ever ad server  The first-ever ad server was founded by a company known as FocaLink Media Services in 1995 by Dave  Zinman, Andrew Conru, and Jason Strober. The company’s name was changed to AdKnowledge in 1998 and was acquired in 1999 by CMGi. Interestingly enough, CMGi was an Internet company in the 1990s and owned many well-known tech and  online businesses, with AltaVista being one of its major portfolio companies. Even though CGMi survived the dot-com crash in the late 1990s and early 2000s, they sold AltaVista in 2003  to Overture Services, Inc, which was taken over by Yahoo in the same year due to mounting pressure from  the board of directors following the 9/11 terror attacks and subsequent stock-market crash.",1213,219,303.25
75,30,"After some time, difficulties started to arise when the number of websites, and therefore publishers, began to  increase. The once-straightforward direct sales process started to become more complex and drawn-out. While premium ads—those bought by advertisers directly from the publishers—were still common, publishers  soon found that a lot of other available inventory wasn’t being filled and fell victim to oversupply. Moreover, advertisers had to sign individual insertion orders with every publisher they wanted to work with and  coordinate the campaign execution. To overcome these problems, advertising networks (aka ad networks) started to appear.",655,96,163.75
76,30,"In 1996, a  company called DoubleClick emerged as one of the first ad networks. A brief history of DoubleClick  DoubleClick was founded in 1996 by Kevin O’Connor and Dwight Merriman. It was purchased by private  equity firms Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity in July 2005 for US$1.1 billion. Then, in March 2008, it was  acquired by Google for US$3.1 billion. DoubleClick was one of the few online companies to survive the dot-com bubble between the mid-’90s and  early 2000s.",476,85,119.0
77,31,"brands: Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and Google Ad Manager. In the beginning, ad networks acted as brokers between advertisers and publishers and enabled publishers to  monetize their inventory without the need for in-house sales or AdOps teams. They would aggregate unsold inventory from publishers and offer advertisers a consolidated and generally less  expensive pool of impressions. 38",400,60,100.0
78,32,"Ad networks benefit both advertisers and publishers. They provide publishers with a highly effective way to sell their remnant inventory, which could be as little as a  few percent to all of their inventory, depending on how many direct deals they have with advertisers. They also help cut down on the time and money associated with selling inventory to advertisers and offer a  range of services, such as campaign setup, optimization, and technical support (aka troubleshooting). These  services are known today as ad trafficking. Advertisers benefit by receiving high cost savings and an easier, more effective way to connect with audiences  on a much larger scale.",667,110,166.75
79,32,"However, even though the introduction of ad networks added fluency to the ad buying and selling process,  many ad networks only wanted to purchase part of publishers’ inventory (i.e. the parts that matched their  campaigns) which meant publishers had to work with multiple ad networks in order to sell all of their inventory. 39",328,56,82.0
80,33,"Not only did this mean publishers would have to spend more time searching for the best-valued ad networks  and pay multiple commissions, it also meant they would have set up the inefficient and tedious waterfall  system. For advertisers, this also created challenges. They soon found that they weren’t able to reach their target  audience by using just one ad network, so they started buying inventory from multiple ad networks. However,  this meant they often bought the same audience more than once, lacked clear insights into the effectiveness of  their ads, and struggled to identify their best-performing inventory. To overcome these challenges, a new AdTech platform arrived on the scene – network optimizers , which are  known today as supply-side platforms (SSPs) .",773,128,193.25
81,33,"Network optimizers allowed publishers to:  ● Eliminate the time-consuming task of managing multiple ad networks. ● Improve page-load time by sending a single request to a network optimizer rather than sending  requests back and forth between the ad networks and the publisher’s ad server (i.e. the waterfall  technique). ● Increase revenue by matching their inventory to the right ad network. ● Maintain strict quality controls by blocking certain advertisers, e.g. ones that advertised taboo products  and services, such as tobacco and alcohol. Shortly after the introduction of network optimizers, ad exchanges emerged to solve the many technical  nuisances found in ad networks, such as multiple redirects, and allowed advertisers to purchase inventory on  an impression-by-impression basis.",794,122,198.5
82,33,Ad exchanges were one of the AdTech platforms involved in the invention  and growth of real-time bidding (RTB) . This was how the online advertising industry looked in the early days – a handful of AdTech platforms helping  advertisers and publishers explore the possibilities that technology and the internet had to offer. Fast forward to today and the online advertising ecosystem consists of numerous platforms that have arisen  over the years to solve the many challenges both advertisers and publishers have faced and to improve the  overall buying and selling of digital media.

Advertising agencies are generally independent, external companies working for their clients, which can  include businesses, international corporations, non-profit organizations, and governments. Traditionally, brands hired ad agencies to produce television commercials and run print campaigns in  magazines, newspapers, and on billboards, but also to take care of other forms of promotion and marketing. Due to the growth and rise in popularity of the internet, agencies use an array of advertising and marketing  technologies to create, run, manage, and measure online campaigns. These types of agencies are also known  as interactive, creative, media, or digital agencies.",838,121,209.5
92,38,"The History of Advertising Agencies  Before advertising agencies were born, ads were delivered to various media outlets through representatives  who, in the early days of advertising, sold and re-sold advertising space with a markup. These were the humble beginnings of fully fledged advertising companies, i.e. agencies. With time, the agencies would take on additional responsibilities: planning, writing, designing, and coordinating  ads. The first bona fide agencies date back as far as 1786 when William Taylor opened his office in London, today  acknowledged as the first advertising agency in history . However, while the UK business is considered the  precursor of advertising agencies in Europe, it was Volney B. Palmer who took the idea across the ocean to  the US.",775,125,193.75

Adland: A Global History of Advertising cites Palmer  describing the services he provided using the term “agent”: “the duly authorized agent of most of the best  newspapers of all the cities and provincial towns in the United States and Canada, for which he is daily  receiving advertisements and subscriptions.” In this way, Palmer’s office at the northwest corner of Third and Chestnut Street in Philadelphia became the  prototype for today’s advertising agency. In 1842, he bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at  a discounted rate, then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad, including the copy,  layout, and artwork, was prepared by the client, which basically made Palmer an ad-space broker with little  influence on the creative side.",839,141,209.75

Even though publishers don’t need to use an SSP to sell their inventory on the ad exchange, the technology  used in SSPs provides many benefits that allow them to receive the most yield from their inventory and gain  clearer insights into their audience. 58",351,63,87.75
112,52,"Some popular ad exchanges and SSPs include:  What’s the difference between an SSP and an ad exchange? In short, SSPs offer their clients tools to help them manage their inventory, sell their inventory on ad  exchanges, and optimize yield. Ad exchanges allow DSPs and SSPs to come together and conduct media transactions, sort of like an  eBay for ads. However, most SSPs nowadays also exchange mechanisms, meaning DSPs can connect directly to  SSPs and purchase inventory through RTB auctions. This DSP-SSP connection is achieved by using  the OpenRTB protocol (more on that in a later chapter).",595,101,148.75
113,52,"Data-Management Platform (DMP) – For Publishers  While data-management platforms have typically been associated with advertisers, they also provide  publishers with a number of opportunities. The main things publishers can do with a DMP include:  ● Creating another revenue stream with audience extension. ● Increasing the cost of their inventory. ● Improving engagement with content personalization. 59",403,59,100.75
114,53,"We explain more about what a DMP is and how it works in chapter 11. Data Management Platforms (DMPs)  and Data Usage . Data Broker  A data broker – also known as an information broker , data provider , and data supplier – collects and sells  offline and online consumer data to other companies. Data brokers buy data from different publishers and other data holders (credit-card companies, telecoms and  ISPs, retailers etc.)combine it into aggregated audiences (aka segments).",477,82,119.25
115,53,"Segments are most commonly organized into different categories, such as demographics (gender, age, income  groups, etc.),interests (sports, travel, etc.),purchase intent (e.g. car/home buyers), and many others. These segments are then sold to advertisers and used for ad targeting, typically by connecting to demand-side  platforms and data-management platforms. 60",365,50,91.25
116,54,"Below are a few of the main data brokers that supply data to advertisers:  Verification and Measurement  Verification services use technology to provide advertisers with additional information about their online  advertising campaigns. The information provided by verification services can inform the advertiser about the following:  ● On which websites the ads were displayed. ● Where they were displayed (geolocation). ● What percentage of ads were viewable by the user. ● If fraudulent traffic was detected, e.g. impressions, clicks, and/or conversions generated by bots.",574,87,143.5
117,54,"● If the ads were displayed next to questionable content (e.g. illegal or offensive content). Measurement and analytics companies provide detailed analysis of the performance and reach of online ads. They also provide detailed insights into customer behavior, trends and other user-centric data to help  advertisers improve the performance and targeting capabilities of their campaigns. It’s important to note that the analytics mentioned here are different than the analytics used for tracking and  reporting on website traffic or in-app user behavior. Web/app analytics are part of the marketing-technology (MarTech) ecosystem; however, more and more web-  and marketing-analytics solutions are providing insights into ad campaigns.",734,107,183.5
118,55,"providing more robust platforms that combine several functions and cover many different areas connecting  both the online marketing and advertising technology spaces. Here’s an overview of how ad-verification tools work:  Here is what’s happening in the image above:  ● A user opens a web page, which contains a dedicated space where an ad loads (an ad slot). ● Demand-side platforms (DSPs) are called via supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges and ad  networks. When there is a direct publisher-advertiser deal, the ad code (aka ad markup) is configured  directly in the publisher’s ad server, including the creative, impression-tracking pixel and ad-verification  code. ● The DSP with the highest bid wins the impression.",727,117,181.75
119,55,"An ad is sent to the publisher’s site via the ad  markup. ● As the ad is loaded, the ad-verification code in the ad markup collects information about the website  and user – ad placement, audience, engagement, etc. ● The ad-verification vendor sends performance reports to the advertiser. Creative Optimization  A creative optimization company works with media buyers (advertisers and agencies) to improve the  performance of online ad campaigns. These creative optimization companies usually add a layer of rich media, such as video, to the standard  banner ads to make them more interactive, dynamic, and appealing — thus improving their effectiveness.",654,106,163.5
120,56,"Dynamic creative optimization (DCO) platforms utilize user data to personalize the creative and run A/B tests  to determine the best-performing variant of the creative — all with minimal human involvement. The Sell Side (Publisher)  Publishers (websites and apps) represent the sell side, as they are the ones wanting to sell the ad space to  media buyers. Advertising Operations (AdOps)  The AdOps department on the publisher’s side is responsible for setting up the advertiser’s ad campaigns in  their ad server (known as a first-party ad server or publisher’s ad server), trafficking tags, configuring  header-bidding wrappers and making changes to campaigns if required. First-Party Ad Server  This technological platform allows publishers to manage the ad slots on their website and display ads that have  been sold directly to advertisers (i.e. direct campaigns). In the event that no direct campaigns are available,  first-party ad servers will act as a management platform whereby they decide which ad codes (i.e ones from a  third-party ad server, SSP, or ad network) to serve in their ad slots.",1104,181,276.0
121,56,"Does everyone need an ad server? Short answer: No. A large majority of publishers would use an ad server, but not every advertiser would. As most DSPs offer ad-serving capabilities, advertisers could just use a DSP to store and manage their  creatives. It is also possible for publishers to just use an SSP instead of an ad server, as many SSPs also offer  ad-serving functionality and allow publishers to run different types of campaigns.",439,76,109.75
122,56,"However, publishers benefit from having an ad server, as it allows them to easily change SSP vendors if  needed. Moreover, smaller publishers could just add the ad codes directly into their website, which would  eliminate the need to add and manage a new system. 63",265,47,66.25
123,57,"Here are a few popular ad servers for publishers:  How AdTech Companies Make Money  Building and maintaining advertising-technology platforms is a highly expensive exercise with high costs  associated with infrastructure and staffing (developers, technical persons, managers, sales teams, etc). AdTech vendors need to deliver a high-performance product to their clients and ensure their business model  makes money along the way to cover costs and make a profit. Ever since the early days of online advertising, technology providers have made their money by charging  commissions and fees, typically as a percentage on top of the cost of media. Historically, most AdTech platforms added about 30% to the cost of the media, but this number has decreased  over the years due to competition and calls for more transparency into the cost of media, as well as fees and  commissions (sometimes referred to as the AdTech tax ). Many AdTech companies claim their take rates are now in the single digits.",995,165,248.75
124,58,"While the above illustration is just an example and every setup is different, this is certainly how an advertiser’s  budget is distributed a majority of the time. The AdTech-tax problem is exacerbated due to the fragmented nature of the online advertising ecosystem  where there are numerous AdTech vendors involved in the supply chain. This not only means that advertisers aren’t getting their full money’s worth, but also that publishers are only  receiving a small part of the advertiser’s budget. Over the past few years, the AdTech industry has started to consolidate. Large AdTech vendors have been acquiring smaller companies and adding them to their client offering.",674,109,168.5
125,58,"This plays a role in reducing the number of individual AdTech vendors involved in the online media-buying  process, which subsequently reduces the amount of AdTech tax applied to a transaction. The Walled Gardens  The AdTech ecosystem can be divided into two groups: independent AdTech companies and walled gardens. The walled gardens refer to the duopoly of Google and Facebook, but increasingly includes Amazon and  Apple. You’ll likely see them written or mentioned as GAFA = G oogle, A pple, F acebook and A mazon. 65",521,88,130.25
126,59,"The reason these companies are called walled gardens is because they have closed-off ecosystems, whereby  they keep their audience and data to themselves, and require brands to use their advertising platforms to  access them. Here’s a quick overview of the power these companies have in online advertising:  Apart from its popular search engine, Google owns many different consumer-facing products that are used by  billions of people, including: Google Mail, Google Maps and YouTube. Google also has multiple advertising products used by advertisers and publishers:  Google Ad Manager (GAM): Includes what was once known as DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) and  DoubleClick Ad Exchange (AdX). This suite allows publishers to manage, sell, and serve their inventory to  advertisers. Google Ads: Previously known as Google AdWords.",830,130,207.5

Standardization in the Ecosystem  In the very early days of online advertising, it became apparent that there would be a need to provide a set of  standards to ensure that different advertising technologies could communicate efficiently with one another and  deliver ads in the correct format. In 1996, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) was founded as a way to standardize the online advertising  industry. 69",575,95,143.75

The Main Digital Advertising Mediums and Channels  Before the Internet existed, brands and agencies used mediums like newspaper ads, direct-mail brochures and  TV commercials to push their message to the masses. Nowadays, they are spoiled for choice with numerous mediums and channels available to them. What’s the difference between a medium and a channel in advertising? The terms medium and channel are often used interchangeably.",437,68,109.25
134,65,"For the sake of consistency, in this book we’ll run with the following definitions:  Medium: A means of verbal or non-verbal communication. Examples include text ads, video ads and radio  ads. Channel: A means of transmission or distribution. Examples include display, social media and TV  advertising. For example, you could create a video ad (medium) and decide to advertise it on Facebook (channel).",402,66,100.5
135,65,"Below are the main mediums and channels advertisers have at their disposal in today’s digital world. Advertising Mediums  Text and Image Ads  When advertising moved online in the late 1990s, the only medium available to advertisers was text and image  ads. As we mentioned earlier in the book, this was the first very online ad:  72",332,60,83.0
136,67,"Although there have been a number of new mediums released over the years, text and image ads are still the  most popular medium for display advertising. Text and image ads can be served and displayed via HTML, JavaScript, iframe and SafeFrame tags. Native Ads  Native ads are designed to blend in with the rest of the surrounding content by following the natural form of the  user experience and matching the design and behavior of the web page, application, or platform. Although native ads are meant to look like the surrounding content, they still need to be a clear and prominent  disclaimer stating that they are paid advertisements. Native ads are generally found on content-rich sites, such as news sites, blogs, and social networks.",740,127,185.0
137,67,"Here are some of the main native-ad formats provided by the IAB’s Native Advertising Playbook 2019 :  Content recommendation ads (formerly known as content recommendation widgets): This form of native  advertising is probably the most subtle. You may have glanced over this type before and presumed that it is  actually content from the website you’re reading. However, the telltale sign is the message above the ads,  usually written as From the web , or Recommended for you . As this type of native advertising appears on content-rich sites, typically at the end of an article.

Branded/ Native Content: (aka sponsored, brand, or custom content): Unlike the previous two forms of  native ads that direct the user away from the site when they click on the ad, branded (aka native) content  involves companies paying to show their branded content on a website, like a news site or blog, and is  displayed just like the other forms of editorial content on the site. Some great examples of branded content come from Netflix’s ad campaigns promoting the shows Orange is  the New Black and House of Cards :  75",659,118,164.75

140,70,"Other Forms of Native Advertising  The first version of the IAB’s Native Advertising Playbook included paid search and promoted listing as  examples of native ads, however, these are no longer classified as native ad types, instead fall under the  Search Advertising category listed below. Video Ads  Video advertising refers to ads displayed in the form of a video, instead of their traditional static form, such as  banner ads. When you think about video advertising, try not to confuse it with television advertising – they are not the same  thing, although it’s getting more difficult to differentiate between the two because of online streaming services. Depending on the channel, serving a video ad is similar to serving an image, text or native ad, except that the  creative (i.e. the video) is sent to and displayed in a video player rather than as part of the web page itself. Also, most video ads are served via protocols developed by the IAB Tech Lab, such as VAST , VPAID , and  VMAP .",997,178,249.25
141,70,"Video ad serving template (VAST)  This protocol solved many of the compatibility issues that advertisers and publishers faced when serving video  ads. VAST supports many different types of video formats (e.g. MP4, 3GP, and MOV), can serve pre-roll,  mid-roll, and end-roll ads, and provides some interactive functionalities like pausing and skipping ads. Video player ad interface definition (VPAID)  VPAID allows advertisers to serve rich, interactive ads to users and collect data about how they interact with  their video ads, such as if users click different tabs to view more information. Advertisers can also collect data on whether users engage with different elements, such as filling in a form,  completing a survey or even playing a game. 77",751,123,187.75
142,71,"In 2017, the IAB Tech Lab announced that it would retire the VPAID standard and replace it with the Secure  Interactive Media Interface Definition (SIMID) for providing interactive functionalities and the Open  Measurement Interface Definition (OMID) for attribution. Here’s a look at how these standards can be used for video advertising:  Video multiple ad playlist (VMAP)  VMAP allows content creators – i.e. those creating the video – to specify where the ad breaks should be  placed. This is especially useful for video-content creators who want to control the video experience but don’t  control the actual video player. Thanks to VMAP, video-content creators can define the following:  ● Ad breaks within their content  ● Timing for each break  ● How many breaks are available  ● How many ads are allowed in each break  Rich Media Ads  Rich media is an interactive form of advertising and can include animated images (e.g. gifs), audio files, and  videos. 78",965,168,241.25
143,72,"Unlike traditional text and image ads, rich-media ads often include elements that allow the user to interact with  the ad, like the ones listed in Google’s Rich Media Showcase :  Rich-media ads come in many different formats , such as:  ● Banners : Similar to the standard text banners, but with interactive elements. ● Expanding : Ads that start off as normal banner ads, but then expand when the user clicks on them. These ads can expand in different directions, such as from right to left or top to bottom. ● Interstitials : Rich-media ads that float on top of the page’s content. ● Lightboxes: These ads are similar to expanding ads in that they expand and often take over the whole  screen when a user interacts (e.g. hovers over the ad for at least two seconds) or clicks on the ad.",788,146,197.0
144,72,"The ads are typically created and displayed using HTML5 or JavaScript and can utilize VAST or the mobile rich  media ad interface definition (MRAID) – another IAB standard. MRAID is an application programming interface (API) used to display rich-media ads in mobile apps. Because mobile apps can be built using different programming languages and run on different operating  systems, MRAID provides a standard framework that allows content creators and advertisers to run rich-media  ads across all mobile devices and apps. Audio Ads  While text, image and video ads have dominated the online-advertising scene for over a decade, new  advertising mediums are gaining popularity, with audio ads as a prime example. Due to the rise in popularity of podcasts, music-streaming services, and digital radio, audio ads are quickly  becoming a new advertising medium for brands and advertisers.",886,142,221.5
145,73,"Due to the similarities between video and audio files, publishers and advertisers can use the latest version of  VAST (4.1) to serve ads and collect relevant data. Once upon a time, there was a separate standard for serving audio ads – digital audio ad serving template  (DAAST) – but this has since merged into VAST 4.1. Just like with other digital advertising mediums, audio ads also come in different formats:  Companion/banner ads: Just like the banner ads you see on web pages and mobile apps, companion or  banner ads can appear on the screen when the user is listening to an audio track (e.g. a podcast or music).

Advertising Channels  Web Advertising  Web advertising has established roots in online advertising. It was the first channel available to brands and  agencies when the world went online back in the late 1990s. This channel refers to advertisements displayed in web browsers on desktops, laptops and mobile devices  (smartphones and tablets).

Examples of CTV include smartTVs, gaming consoles,  and streaming devices. The IAB Tech Lab doesn’t consider desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and  tablets as examples of CTV. Addressable TV: Unlike traditional linear TV advertising that shows the same ads during a given program,  addressable TV aims to display different ads to different viewers during the same program. It is able to achieve this by using data collected via Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), which includes connected TVs  and OTT devices and services, and set-top boxes.",821,144,205.25

Campaign Execution Using an Ad Server: Then and Now  The way online ads have been bought, sold, and delivered has changed a lot over the past two decades, but  what hasn’t changed is the importance and role that ad servers play. 91",418,71,104.5
163,85,"Below is an illustration of how the ad-serving process looked in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and how ad  servers emerged. In the early days of online advertising, executing a campaign was a manual process that only involved direct  communication between the advertiser and publisher. 92",289,49,72.25
164,86,"Then, the publisher’s ad server was introduced to help them run and report on advertisers’ campaigns. Here’s how the basic flow would look:  1. The advertiser and publisher sign an insertion order (IO), which is a document (often a contract) that  outlines the terms of the campaign, including flight dates (start and end dates), placement, ad format  and size, pricing model (e.g. CPM or CPC), and a few other details. 2. The advertiser sends over a list (typically a spreadsheet) of its creatives.",499,86,124.75
165,86,"3. The publisher’s AdOps team sets up the campaign in its ad server. 4. Once the campaign starts, the advertiser then receives ongoing reports from the publisher about the  performance of its campaign, such as impressions and clicks. What’s the Difference Between Ad Trafficking and AdOps?",289,47,72.25
166,87,"Ad trafficking is the name given to the process of setting up, monitoring, and optimizing the campaigns  conducted by ad servers and/or other AdTech platforms. AdOps are people who are responsible for setting up, monitoring, and optimizing campaigns. In short, AdOps refers to the people and ad trafficking refers to the process. First-Party (Publisher’s) Ad Server  A publisher’s ad server is tasked with filling the ad slots on a website by matching ads from direct campaigns,  real-time bidding (RTB) auctions, and other media-buying processes. They do this by making decisions about which ads to show on a website based on the targeting parameters of  campaigns set up by advertisers, serving those ads, and reporting on their performance.",743,121,185.75
167,87,"Another feature of ad servers is inventory forecasting, which involves predicting how much inventory a  publisher will have available in the future and the performance of ad campaigns based on current and historical  data. Soon, advertisers started using ad servers to measure the performance of their campaigns for themselves. These ad servers are known as a third-party or advertiser’s ad server. 94",401,64,100.25
168,88,"Third-Party Ad Servers  Earlier in the book, we outlined the following challenges advertisers faced when dealing directly with  publishers:  ● Limited reach of a single campaign. ● Reporting overhaul – i.e. no single way to measure the campaign across different publishers. ● Reporting verification – i.e. no way to verify the reports provided by the publisher. Even though the invention of the ad server solved many of these challenges through automation, new  challenges arose for advertisers. The booming online ad business was attracting more new publishers; however, not all of them were playing  fair.",607,99,151.75
169,89,"In order to gain the independent reports from their campaigns that ran on multiple publishers and ad networks,  advertisers started using independent ad servers, known now as third-party ad servers (aka advertiser’s ad  server). An ad server allows advertisers to:  ● Track the performance (impressions, clicks, conversions, etc.)of the whole campaign across all  publishers in a single system. ● Measure the reach of a campaign while taking into account the co-viewership across publishers. ● Verify the reports provided by the publishers.",540,85,135.0

171,93,"First-Party vs. Third-Party Ad Servers: A Simple Comparison  While first-party and third-party ad servers are essentially the same type of machine, they fulfill different  responsibilities for publishers and advertisers. First-Party Ad Server  (Publisher’s Ad Server)  Third-Party Ad Server  (Advertiser’s Ad Server)  Allows AdOps to manage ad slots on the website,  run multiple direct campaigns (i.e. direct deals  between the publisher and advertiser) and manage  third-party tags from other ad servers or ad  platforms, such as SSPs. Tracks the performance of the campaigns across all  the sites that are involved in a particular campaign  (e.g. reach, impressions, clicks, conversions),  calculates the return on investment (ROI) and  attributes the conversions to the right publishers. Helps publishers manage and predict their inventory  fill rates across many advertisers, provides reporting  for billing purposes and tracks their earnings and  actual fill rates. A first-party ad server also identifies  the efficiency of third-party demand sources (e.g. via  RTB) and direct deals, which helps publishers  identify which sources are buying the most ad space  and assign priority accordingly.",1201,192,300.25
172,93,"Helps the advertiser optimize its future media buys  based on past data, identifies which sites and  targeting criteria worked and which didn’t, and run  A/B tests to determine which ads deliver the best  performance. Allows publishers to forecast the amount of inventory  that match certain targeting criteria. For example, it  can tell them how much traffic they receive from NY  State on their homepage’s ad placement so that the  sales team can offer the right quantity on insertion  orders for advertisers. Allows advertisers to audit and verify the numbers  (i.e. performance metrics) for billing purposes. How Ad Serving Works From a Technical Perspective  Below are two detailed technical examples of how ad serving works.",730,125,182.5
173,95,"The second illustrates the ad-serving process with both a publisher’s and an advertiser’s ad server:  The Anatomy of an Ad Server  Below you’ll find the various ad-serving components, such as the ones listed in the diagrams above. Ad Tags  An ad tag is a piece of code that is inserted into an ad slot in order to display an ad. There are different types of ad tags depending on their implementation. Below, we list the most common ad tags, how they are used and implemented, and the advantages and  disadvantages they offer:  JavaScript Ad Tags  102",550,102,137.5
174,96,"Usage: For rendering display ads on web pages via a desktop or mobile browser. JavaScript ad tags are  also used for display ads in mobile apps, but generally these will be custom tags or Mobile Rich Media Ad  Interface Definition (MRAID). Implementation: JavaScript ad tags are placed directly in the publisher’s page code. Advantages :  ● Ads can interact with a publisher’s website  ● Viewability can be tracked  ● Ads can be loaded at the same time or after the content is loaded (depends on the implementation)  Disadvantages :  ● Ads can change the content of the publisher’s website, causing it to break its functionality. ● Ads could compromise the security of the website and result in installing malware that captures  sensitive data from forms, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, etc.",807,140,201.75
175,96,"An example of this  is the recent Magecart attack where credit-card details of a possible 380,000 customers were taken  from Newegg and British Airways via JavaScript injection. <script type=""text/javascript""><!--  google_ad_client = ""pub-11111111"";  /* 160x600 - TOP */  google_ad_slot = ""12345"";  google_ad_width = 160;  google_ad_height = 600;  //-->  </script>  <script type=""text/javascript""  src="" http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"" >  </script>  An example of a JavaScript ad tag. Iframe Ad Tags  Usage: For rendering display ads on web pages via a desktop or mobile browser. Implementation : Iframe ad tags are HTML tags that are added to a publisher’s page code. The iframe  completely isolates the code loaded in the iframe, and therefore, prevents it from interacting with the rest of  the content of the website.",846,135,211.5
176,97,"● Increases security by isolating JavaScript code in the iframe so that it cannot interact with elements  on the website. ● Ads load after the contents of the website, which helps decrease the time it takes to load the contents  of the page. Disadvantages :  ● Limited interaction with a publisher’s website – i.e. it requires additional JavaScript code to be  installed on the publisher’s website to implement expandable ads. ● Can’t reliably track the viewability of ads. Here’s an example of an iframe ad tag from OpenX :  <iframe id='a62ae7d3' name='a62ae7d3'  src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/afr?auid=8635&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&rd=5&rm=3""  frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='728' height='90'>  <a href='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/rc?cs=acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""  target='_blank'>  <img  src='http://delivery_server_domain/w/1.0/ai?uid=8635&cs=acd22faf&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""  border='0' alt='' /></a></iframe>  SafeFrame  In order to solve the issues related to both JavaScript ad tags and iframe ad tags, a new standard was  introduced – SafeFrame .",1103,145,275.75
177,97,"SafeFrame is an Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) standard that combines the advantages of iframe and  JavaScript tags and eliminates many of their disadvantages. The SafeFrame ad slots are implemented in JavaScript with an API that loads the actual ads in iframes, but  allows them to interact with its API to expand the content or track viewability. At the same time, it protects the  publisher’s site from unwanted changes and prevents visitors’ sensitive information from being collected. 104",499,80,124.75
178,98,"Here’s how the SafeFrame implementation works:  1. The user accesses the publisher’s website and the browser sends a request to the publisher’s web  server to fetch the content and SafeFrame ad markup. 2. SafeFrame (JavaScript) loads an iframe with the SafeFrame API, allowing it to interact with the  publisher’s site. 3.",322,54,80.5
179,98,"The ad is rendered and shown to the user. 4. At the same time, data is collected by viewability and measurement vendors to provide advertisers  with reports. It’s important to note that the ad in the iframe loaded by the SafeFrame is isolated – i.e. third-party ad  servers can run any JavaScript code inside the iframe, but it won’t affect the publisher’s website. Only  specific sets of instructions and interactions with a publisher’s site are allowed via the SafeFrame API, such  as data collection for viewability and measurement.",535,92,133.75
180,98,"VAST and VPAID (For Video Ads)  When it comes to serving video ads, the video ad-serving template (VAST) and video player ad-serving  interface definition (VPAID) formats are used. VAST is an XML schema developed by the IAB. It enables in-stream video ads (i.e. ads are displayed in the  video player, like on YouTube) served from video ad servers and played in video players on a number of  publisher sites and on different devices (e.g. desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.). VPAID is a piece of JavaScript that enables video ad units and video players to interact with one another. IMG Ad Tags  105",594,106,148.5
181,99,"IMG ad tags are HTML tags and are similar to iframe tags. Usage: These ad tags are mainly used to display ads in mobile apps and in the <noscript> section of other  types of ad tags, which are used as fallbacks when the browser does not support or execute JavaScript. Implementation:  Most AdTech platforms and publishers will only accept snippets of HTML/IMG ad tags and not full HTML  code (e.g. no <html>, <head> or <title> tags). See example of an HTML/IMG ad tag below:  <a href= ""https://www.clearcode.cc/"" > <img src= ""http://clearcode250x250.jpg"" > </a>  Advantages:  ● HTML/IMG ad tags are simple in structure and format, meaning they can be displayed in web  browsers and apps without facing too many technical issues. ● They can utilize a content-delivery network (CDN) to reduce the time it takes the browser to load  them, increasing the chances of the visitor seeing the ad.",888,156,222.0
182,99,"Disadvantages:  ● HTML/IMG ad tags can’t display rich media ads (e.g. expandable or interactive ads). Spreadsheets with ad tags  In order for advertisers to keep track of ad tags used in their campaigns, they often create spreadsheets. A typical spreadsheet will include the list of placements and the respective ad tags. Even though this is a  manual and error-prone process, it is still the most common way of trafficking the non-programmatic display  campaigns (i.e. direct deals between a publisher and advertiser) and also some programmatic campaigns  when using self-serve AdTech platforms. 106",600,97,150.0
183,100,"Ad Markup  Ad markup is a piece of code that’s retrieved from an ad server or some other AdTech platform via an ad tag  and rendered in an ad slot.

Tracking the impression by loading tracking tags (pixels) for measurement, ad verification, viewability,  etc.",366,67,91.5
184,101,"An example of simple ad markup. Chapter Summary  ● Ad serving is one of the fundamental processes in online advertising. ● A first-party ad server is used by publishers to manage the ad slots on their websites, serve ads from  direct campaigns, manage other campaigns (e.g. real-time bidding), and report on the performance of  the ads (e.g. impressions and clicks). ● A third-party ad server is used by advertisers to manage their creatives, send ads to publishers, and  collect data about the performance of their campaigns. 108",530,91,132.5
185,102,"07. Ad Targeting and Budget Control  In the context of online advertising, targeting relates to displaying ads to users who match a series of criteria. For example, let’s imagine an advertiser who sells gardening products has identified that its target audience  consists of people between the ages of 30 and 50 and who live in rural areas of the US. The advertiser would  then want to display its ads to people who match those criteria. When it comes to direct deals between an advertiser and publisher, targeting was traditionally carried out by ad  servers, whereby an advertiser would define the targeting criteria in the insertion order – e.g. state which  pages and sections of a publisher’s site to show its ads on.",722,127,180.5
186,102,"The publisher’s AdOps team would then configure the advertiser’s targeting criteria in its ad server (first-party  ad server). Even though targeting is still carried out via ad servers, many other AdTech platforms (e.g. demand-side  platforms and supply-side platforms) now offer targeting capabilities. In this chapter, we’ll talk about targeting in the context of ad servers. By setting targeting criteria for a campaign, an advertiser can choose which web traffic is relevant for them. 109",492,76,123.0
187,103,"Below are some examples of targeting methods in online advertising. Contextual Targeting  Contextual targeting allows advertisers to display relevant ads based on the website’s content rather than data  about the visitor. This method of targeting is widely used in magazines and newspapers. Contextual ads are a way to precisely target the ad without excessive need for personal data. Many advertisers and publishers use contextual targeting, either in isolation or in combination with other  targeting methods, because it’s very effective for specific kinds of content.",570,87,142.5
188,104,"In contextual targeting, every element of the process uses information about the website and page to determine  which ads to display. A step-by-step explanation of how contextual targeting works:  1. A web crawler scans URLs and categorizes the content and ad placements. 2. When a visitor accesses a website, information associated with the URL is passed to the ad server via  the ad request.",393,67,98.25
189,104,"3. This ad request and the contextual information is passed on to other AdTech platforms, such as ad  exchanges and supply-side platforms. 4. The ad exchanges and supply-side platforms relay this information to demand-side platforms, which  then bid on the impression. 5.",271,44,67.75
190,105,"Benefits of Contextual Targeting  Although contextual targeting may seem rather simple compared to other targeting methods, it provides  advertisers and publishers with a number of benefits:  ● Most contextual ads don’t rely on personal data, helping advertisers and publishers reduce their  exposure to privacy and data-protection regulations, like the GDPR. ● Contextual ads can offer safer brand protection. ● They have shown they can increase purchase intent by 63%. ● They are found to be less unnerving than behaviorally targeted ads, while still being based on the  interests of users – e.g. advertisers can show ads for smartphone plans to people reading articles  about smartphones. Keywords  Keywords are valuable targeting variables for advertisers as they provide an accurate picture of the type of  content the website visitor is consuming.",853,137,213.25
191,105,"There are a couple of ways an ad server can identify which keywords are on a given web page, such as via the  tags used on the page by the editor that highlight the key topics covered in the content and via extracting the  keywords found on the page, usually done either with JavaScript or server-side web crawling. These keywords are then typically passed to the ad tag, so that the ad server receives them in the ad request  and uses them in the decisioning process (when deciding which ad to serve). So, for example, if an advertiser wants to display ads promoting a new smartphone plan, it would target visitors  who read articles containing the keywords smartphone , mobile phone , etc. Ad Slot and Ad Position  Advertisers may also want to display ads that are of a certain size or located in a specific area of a webpage –  for example, ad slots that are 728×90 px and located at the top of the page. Because this type of targeting is quite broad, it is usually combined with other targeting methods.",1007,189,251.75
192,105,"Publisher’s URL  Targeting users based on the publisher’s URL is very similar to the way advertisers target consumers in print  media. By displaying ads on specific websites, advertisers are able to reach a broad range of online consumers based  on their interests, rather than based on their demographic information like age and gender. There are two levels at which advertisers can target website visitors:  112",413,69,103.25
193,106,"Domain  Advertisers can target audiences based on the publisher’s domain name. However, this only applies in a direct  advertiser-publisher relationship where the publisher owns many different websites. This is often connected with run-on-site (ROS) targeting in ad networks, whereby advertisers show their ads on  specific domains. Section and URLs  The advertiser may choose to target certain sections of the site. For example, if a site covers a lot of topics (like a news site), the advertiser may want to only target the  technology section or entertainment section.",571,92,142.75
194,106,"The problem is that usually these aren’t clearly identified by just the URL and the publisher may need to pass  the section name in the ad tag to enable the ad server to use this variable in its targeting. This method of targeting is often connected with run-on-network (RON) targeting in ad networks, whereby  advertisers show their ads on a specific group of websites. IP and Geolocation  Geolocation targeting involves displaying ads to users based on their current location. For example, if an online consumer was reading news articles on a laptop in Chicago, they could very well see  ads promoting shops, restaurants and services in the Chicago area. But how do advertisers know where consumers are located?",713,122,178.25
195,106,"An ad server receives a request from the consumer’s browser, which carries its IP address. The IP address is  mapped to the specific location of the consumer using an external database, such as MaxMind or Neustar ,  which maps the IP address to the country, region and city. 113",278,51,69.5
196,107,"The image above is a query from MaxMind. Native mobile apps can also pass the exact longitude and latitude from a smartphone’s GPS to the ad server. In such cases, the ad server is capable of targeting the users within a radius of a certain point (e.g. within five  miles of a given point of sale). This makes geolocation targeting much more accurate and precise than the IP  address method. However, even GPS information can sometimes be inaccurate and even fraudulent.",470,83,117.5
197,107,"To improve the accuracy of location data, some data companies collect, aggregate, and combine different data  points and sensors. Imagine this situation: A consumer is eating a sandwich on a bench in downtown New York and playing a  game on their smartphone. Starbucks (i.e. the advertiser) could display an ad to that consumer encouraging  them to visit the Starbucks cafe located five minutes down the road from the consumer’s location. Browser Type, Operating System and Device Type  Every ad request to the ad server carries a user-agent HTTP header, e.g.:  User-agent: Mozilla/ 5.0 (Macintosh ; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,  like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.101 Safari/537.36  This is Mac OS X 10.12 .6 running Chrome 60.0 .3112.101  In the example above, 14D27 identifies as an iPhone 7 Plus, and we see it’s running iOS 10.2.1. From this information, we can parse the operating system, browser type and version, and can detect the  device type, brand and model (in the case of mobile devices, as shown above with the iPhone).",1050,178,262.5
198,108,"Targeting online consumers based on their hardware or software enables advertisers to reach a specific  audience with a highly relevant message. For example, a mobile-gaming company could display ads promoting its newly developed Android game to  consumers using Android-powered smartphones and tablets. IAB Content Taxonomy  The IAB provides a standard for the categorization of websites. Advertisers are able to purchase digital ad space based on the categories supplied in the ad request, and can  also choose not to show their ads on websites based on the categories.

200,110,"Examples of some IAB content categories. Source: Github  Day of Week and Time of Day  Displaying ads to consumers based on the day of the week and even time of day can allow advertisers to  reach their desired audience at the right time, and also to avoid wasting their ad budget. For example, an advertiser that works for a large pizza restaurant could advertise its Friday night specials on  Friday afternoons between 3–8pm. This would work out to be especially beneficial if its ad was being displayed  next to competitors that weren’t offering any special promotions targeted for that particular day. Similarly, if a brand notices that ad engagement is higher at certain times of day, then it could opt to display ads  to its audiences at those times.",755,135,188.75

202,111,"Behavioral Targeting  Behavioral targeting, also known as online behavioral advertising (OBA), allows advertisers and publishers to  display relevant ads and marketing messages to users based on their web-browsing behavior. The types of data collected for behavioral targeting include:  ● Pages viewed  ● Previous search terms  ● Amount of time spent on a website  ● Ads and buttons clicked  ● Content viewed and downloaded  ● Purchases  ● Date of the last website visit  ● Other information about their interactions with various websites  118",543,93,135.75
203,112,Online behavioral targeting uses information about the user to determine which ads to display. The behavioral targeting process consists of three main steps:  119,162,25,40.5
204,113,"1. Data Collection  Advertisers, publishers, and DMPs collect data about the actions users carry out across different websites. This data is often referred to as event data and includes page views, products views, products purchased, and  other interactions on a website or mobile app. This data is then tied together via identifiers stored inside  third-party and first-party cookies in web browsers, or mobile IDs in mobile apps. User profiles are then created to store a given user’s event data in one place and assign all future event data  to that user profile.",566,96,141.5
205,113,"An identifier, such as an ID in a third-party cookie or a mobile ID, would be used to link a  user with their actions across different websites and assign the event data to the right user profile. 2. Audience Creation  Advertisers and publishers then create audiences that are made up of individual user profiles. For example, an advertiser could create an audience that includes people who have viewed a given product  more than three times in a month, signed up for a newsletter, and have visited their website at least 15 times in  the past 60 days. 3.",555,102,138.75
206,113,"Application of Data  The advertiser then uses those audiences for ad targeting in its online media campaigns, resulting in the ads  being more relevant to the users and increasing the chances of them converting (e.g. purchasing a product). The three main steps of the behavioral targeting process. 120",301,50,75.25
207,114,"Benefits of Behavioral Targeting  The amount of data marketers have about users allows them to create very detailed profiles and display ads  relevant to each audience accordingly. The premise behind behavioral targeting is that it benefits the visitor as much as it benefits the website  displaying the ads – i.e users are shown ads that they are actually interested in, which improves the user  experience of the website. However, online users have become aware of how online advertising companies collect and use their data,  which has resulted in some users becoming concerned about this type of targeting and resulted in the rise of  ad-blocking software. Challenges of Behavioral Targeting and the Impact of the GDPR  With privacy laws like the General Data-Protection Regulation (GDPR) in effect, this targeting method became  challenged by stricter rules concerning storing cookies in a user’s browser. The EU law forced marketers to reduce their dependence on behavioral data and look for new targeting  methods that don’t rely heavily on collecting and using personal data.",1083,178,270.75
208,114,"In addition to privacy laws, there are also privacy settings in popular web browsers, such as Safari’s Intelligent  Tracking Prevention (ITP) and Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) , that block third-party cookies by  default and put restrictions on other types of cookies. Google Chrome, which is the most popular web browser  globally, will also turn off support for third-party cookies in 2022. In addition to the privacy changes in web browsers, Apple has made some changes to how its identifier for  advertisers (IDFA) can be accessed by app developers and AdTech companies to increase user privacy. These privacy changes make running behavioral advertising campaigns extremely limited, if not impossible. In a privacy-first world, some advertising platforms that previously prided themselves on their  behavioral-targeting capabilities are now turning to contextual advertising, where the power lies in minimized  reliance on personal data.",956,146,239.0
209,114,"However, due to the huge time, cost and resource investments AdTech and data-collection companies have  made in collecting and using behavioral data, this shift is a slow one. Please refer to chapter 14. User Privacy in Digital Advertising for more information about these privacy  topics. Retargeting  Retargeting involves showing ads to online visitors who have interacted with the brand in the past. For example, if an online visitor views a pair of shoes, then they’ll likely see the same pair of shoes (or even  different ones) advertised on different websites.",566,94,141.5
210,115,"The process works by placing a 1×1 transparent image (a pixel) on a website. Then, when the page loads, the  pixel sends a request to an AdTech platform (e.g. a demand-side platform) to retrieve the 1×1 transparent  image. As the image is returned to the web browser, the DSP creates a cookie, if one wasn’t created previously, and  saves it on the visitor’s device. Then, when the visitor accesses a different website, the DSP is able to identify that user and show them the  retargeted ad – i.e. the shoes they viewed on the previous website. Here’s a visual representation of how retargeting works:  122",606,110,151.5
211,117,Here’s an overview of what’s happening in the image above:  1. An online shopper visits shoeholics.com and views a pair of shoes. 2. The retargeting service’s code located in between the <footer> tags sends a request for a 1×1 pixel. 3.,236,42,59.0

The shopper leaves shoeholics.com and visits a different website — news.com — and sees an ad for  the exact same pair of shoes that they were looking at previously. The DSP is able to identify the same visitors across different websites by syncing cookies with other AdTech  platforms – for example, supply-side platforms (SSPs) and ad exchanges. Similarly to behavioral targeting, many online visitors have come to dislike retargeted ads, as they appear to  “follow” visitors around the internet.",718,118,179.5

Demographic  Demographic targeting is one of the most powerful forms of targeting and can be used in combination with  other methods to really refine the targeting criteria. At the same time, it’s very tricky because most publishers  don’t ask nor collect this type of information from their visitors, except for companies like Facebook and  Google. Examples of demographic information include, but are not limited to:  ● Age  ● Gender  ● Annual income  ● Marital status  ● Parental status  ● Occupation  So, for example, if an advertiser wanted to display ads promoting baby products to female users, between 20  and 40 years of age, who have one child or more, it could use demographic targeting and other targeting  methods to display ads to the right visitors.",886,158,221.5
214,117,"With campaigns run on independent AdTech platforms (i.e. not via Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), advertisers can use demographic targeting by using audience segments in their DMP or via the data contained  in the User object in OpenRTB bid requests. When running campaigns using demographic data on Google and Facebook and other platforms that collect  this type of data directly from users, advertisers simply need to set up the targeting criteria inside those  platforms. 124",480,77,120.0
215,118,"An example of how to use demographic targeting when advertising on Facebook. Controlling a Campaign’s Budget  When running an ad campaign, advertisers not only focus on making changes to improve its effectiveness by  adjusting the message, placement, targeting, etc.,but also aim to reduce ad waste by optimizing and  improving the efficiency of their campaign’s budgets. What is ad waste? Ad waste is inventory that the advertiser paid for but didn’t reach the target audience – e.g. was shown to  the wrong audience or a bot.",527,89,131.75
216,118,"There are a number of factors that can cause an ad to be deemed wasted, including viewability, ad fraud,  incorrect frequency. We cover these areas throughout the book. Below are just a few areas advertisers look at when controlling and managing their campaign budgets, all of  which can be implemented in an ad server or DSP:  125",331,60,82.75
217,119,"Budget Capping  Adding a budget cap to an ad campaign sets a limit on how much money will be spent. For example, you could set a daily budget cap of $150, meaning that once the campaign has spent that  amount of money, no more ads will be shown that day. Limiting a campaign’s budget involves putting a total and daily cap on the amount of money a campaign  spends. In this case, once the daily budget has been spent, the campaign will stop for that day. Some platforms will add a certain percentage (e.g. 20%) on top of the daily budget to help advertisers get the  most out of their campaign  The image above illustrates how a maximum daily budget could be spent.",665,128,166.25
218,119,"The daily cap can be larger to make up for the under-delivery of ads on certain days, but it may cause the  campaign to stop prematurely. Budget Distribution (aka Pacing)  Pacing refers to how quickly or slowly the budget of the campaign is spent, which impacts how many  impressions are served to online consumers over any given period during the campaign’s lifetime. 126",372,66,93.0
219,120,"For example, you may want to get your ads in front of as many consumers as quickly as you can, so you would  choose to deliver the maximum number of impressions as soon as possible, known as ASAP pacing . Alternatively, you may choose to distribute your ads evenly and allow them to run for the duration of the  campaign’s proposed dates, known as uniform pacing . Examples of ASAP and uniform pacing:  In the real world, pacing also has to account for the fluctuation of ad traffic throughout the day and the  availability of the ad impressions matching the campaign’s targeting criteria. Ad platforms can adjust the speed in which they spend the campaign budget based on performance,  availability of traffic, and price of the inventory/audience:  127",753,134,188.25
220,121,Frequency Capping  Frequency capping involves limiting the number of times the same ad is shown to a given visitor. For example: three impressions per visitor per 24 hours. Frequency capping is important because it:  ● Limits budget waste. ● Helps to improve a campaign’s overall reach. ● Prevents so-called “overexposure” (a user’s frustration over seeing the ad multiple times).,380,61,95.0
221,122,"An example of implementing frequency capping in Google Ads. Let’s see a frequency-capping example:  Three impressions per visitor per 24 hours  Each time frequency capping is evaluated, the number of impressions within the period of time is counted. For a 24-hour cap of three impressions, the impressions could fire at 7:00, 19:00, 1:00 the next day and 10:00  the next day. The user will never see the same ad more than three times within a 24-hour period. 129",462,81,115.5
222,123,"How Is Frequency Capping Implemented? First, the ad server registers and stores the number of times an ad (impression) from a particular campaign is  displayed to a consumer based on their identifiers (e.g. cookies, device IDs, device fingerprints, etc.). Then, it stores this information server-side (i.e. in the ad server) along with the user’s identifier. This information is often referred to as user profiles on AdTech platforms. Every user profile contains the information associated with the given cookie ID or device ID, such as the ads  that the user was exposed to.",575,94,143.75
223,123,"They are typically stored in in-memory or other fast-access databases so that the information can be quickly  fetched during the decisioning process of the ad server. Why not store this information client-side (i.e. in a third-party cookie)?Here are a couple of reasons:  ● The cookie size would dramatically increase. Instead of storing a single ID, we would have to store  each ad ID with the corresponding impressions and their time. ● It’s not portable to other visitor-identification technologies, such as device IDs (AdID / IDFA).",536,88,134.0
224,123,"Chapter Summary  ● There are many different targeting methods that advertisers can use. ● The most popular ones are contextual, behavioral, and demographic. ● Advertisers can control their advertising budgets by setting daily and campaign caps, as well as using  pacing and frequency capping. 130",296,47,74.0
225,124,"08. Tracking and Reporting Impressions, Clicks, and  Conversions in AdTech Platforms  In the previous chapters of this book, we looked at how advertisers and publishers use AdTech platforms to set  up and run campaigns. In this chapter we’ll take a look at how AdTech platforms collect data so advertisers and publishers can track  and view detailed reports about the performance of their campaigns. 131",403,68,100.75
226,125,"Most of the explanations and examples in this chapter illustrate how tracking and reporting works in both a  publisher’s and an advertiser’s ad server, but many other platforms like DSPs and SSPs also include these  functionalities. Impression, Click, and Conversion Tracking  Tracking is an important part of an AdTech platform and is the first step in understanding the performance of an  ad campaign and measuring key metrics. Essentially, tracking involves gathering data about an ad campaign. There are a number of areas that AdTech platforms track, including basic metrics like impressions, clicks and  conversions, and others like viewability and ad-exposure time. They can also track metrics from video ads,  such asplays, completion rates, and average time played.",773,123,193.25
227,125,"Impression Tracking  Impression tracking is quite simply tracking the number of impressions each ad receives. An impression is counted each time it is displayed to a user. For example, if a user visits a web page and sees an ad, then reloads the page and sees the exact same ad  again, two impressions would be counted. The most popular method of counting an impression is to serve a 1×1 transparent image that notifies the ad  server of an impression. It’s called an impression tracker (or impression pixel ).",510,91,127.5
228,125,"The ad server returns a pixel in the ad markup to count the impression when the browser renders the ad  markup – as opposed to counting it when the ad server selects the ad – and returns the ad markup to the  browser. This way, the ad impression is counted when the browser loads the creative. Here’s an example of an impression tracker from the Google Ad Manager ad server (formerly DoubleClick For  Publishers):  132",418,79,104.5
229,126,"The ad server can include a number of additional pixels in the ad markup from third-party AdTech platforms in  order to count the impression in multiple systems – e.g. a third-party ad server used only for measurement or  an ad-verification platform. This process of loading other tags or pixels making calls to other platforms is known as piggybacking . There are two main methods of counting an impression in both the publisher’s and advertiser’s ad servers:  Method 1  The publisher’s ad server includes two 1×1 pixels in the ad markup. The first pixel sends a request to the publisher’s ad server, which counts the impression, and the second  pixel sends a request to the advertiser’s ad server, which also counts the impression. Both pixels are sent to their respective ad servers at the same time.",803,140,200.75
230,126,Impression tracking: Method 1  Method 2  Both the publisher’s and the advertiser’s ad servers count the impression only when their respective ad  servers have received a request for an ad. 133,192,34,48.0
231,127,"Impression tracking: Method 2  Click Tracking  Tracking the number of clicks an ad receives is typically done via a click tracker. A click tracker is the URL of the ad server’s redirect service, which counts the click and redirects the visitor to  the final landing page of the campaign. The ad server returns the click tracker in the ad markup in order to count the click before the visitor is  redirected to the final landing page. Below is an example of a click tracker from the Google Ad Manager ad server:  Here’s the basic flow of how a click tracker works:  134",568,108,142.0
232,128,"How click tracking works in a publisher’s ad server. The diagram above illustrates how click tracking works with a publisher’s ad server, but what if the advertiser  wants to track the click as well? To achieve this, they would need to add a click redirect from the publisher’s ad server to the advertiser’s ad  server, then redirect the user to the landing page. 135",367,66,91.75
233,129,"How click tracking works in a publisher’s and advertiser’s ad servers. The reason why the advertiser’s ad server would also count the same click and impression is to verify the  reports provided by the publisher by comparing the number of impressions and clicks, as well as to aggregate  all campaign data in one system (i.e. the advertiser’s ad server). It is possible to add a lot more redirects to conduct more processes, such as:  ●  Ad verification to detect viewable impressions, bots, and fraudulent activity. ●  Tracking clicks in middlemen systems, such as ad networks. Click URL Macros  Click trackers can support passing the destination URL as a parameter (e.g. redir_url=).",685,117,171.25
234,129,"This functionality is  necessary to add multiple click trackers in the redirect chain and pass the URL of the next redirect dynamically  to the click tracker. Typically, when we paste a click tracker in the ad server, we can use the click URL macro to expand the URL  of the next click tracker in the chain. Here’s an example:  https://ad.example.org/click?ad_id= 123456 &redir_url=%%click_url%%  The ad server automatically expands the %%CLICK_URL%% placeholder to the next click tracker in the chain  (i.e. its own click tracker). For example:  136",550,93,137.5

A goal could be to get consumers to purchase a product, download a file, or even fill in a contact form on a  landing page. Each time a consumer completes one of these actions, a conversion will be recorded. In online advertising and marketing, conversion tracking is used to report on campaign performance. Also, it is  used in conjunction with the cost-per-action (CPA) model where publishers and affiliate advertisers/marketers  only receive payment once a conversion is registered.",727,114,181.75
236,130,"There are two main types of conversions: click-through conversion and view-through conversion . Click-through is when a user has clicked on an ad AND converted. To calculate the click-through conversion (CTC) rate, you divide the number of conversions by the number of  clicks that ad received. CTC % = (conversions ÷ clicks) x 100  View-through is when a user has seen an ad AND didn’t click it BUT converted. For example, if they saw an ad for a pair of shoes, but instead of clicking on the ad and purchasing them, they  went to the website directly and purchased them.",572,103,143.0
237,130,"To calculate the view-through conversion (VTC) rate, you divide the number of conversions by the number of  impressions the ad received. VTC % = (conversions ÷ impressions) x 100  The CTC and VTC rates will vary widely from one advertiser to another, as there are a number of factors at  play, such as the product or service the advertiser is promoting and the audience exposed to the ads. What is an attribution window? With both conversion models, there is something called an attribution window , which refers to the time  between when a user first saw or clicked on the ad and the time they actually converted. The attribution window varies between advertisers, but it can be anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days.",714,128,178.5
238,130,"Finding the right attribution-window time frame can be tricky because the longer an attribution window is, the  less accurate the attribution becomes. It can be difficult to know whether a user converted because they saw an ad 30 days before the conversion  or because they were persuaded to convert via some other advertising channel. 137",339,57,84.75
239,131,"Similarly, if the attribution window is too short, it could exclude some users who were exposed to the ad and  converted as a result of seeing the ad. This not only affects the advertiser’s attribution reports, but also  impacts the publisher’s potential revenue. The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of conversions are as follows:  Click-through conversion  View-through conversion  Advantages  Allows advertisers to accurately  attribute the clicks to conversions,  leaving little or no room for  inaccurate reporting. Depending on the product or  service being promoted, this type  of conversion can work better for  middle- and top-funnel campaigns  than for click-through conversions. Disadvantages  One of the main disadvantages of  this method has more to do with  the attribution model than the  click-through conversion itself.",851,141,212.75
240,131,"For example, if you use the first or  last click-attribution model, it can  be hard to know if that click was  the event that actually influenced  the user to convert. It’s possible that the ad was  displayed to the user, but they  may not have actually seen it (the  ad might not have been in the  viewport of the browser) or been  influenced by it. In other words, it’s  possible to attribute too many  conversions to the campaign. Conversion attribution may be lost  if a visitor deletes their cookies in  the time between seeing the ad  and converting. This method is also more prone to  fraud.",598,121,149.5
241,131,"For example, it’s possible  that the pixel could be fired without  the actual creative being shown. Then, if the user coverts, it will be  recorded as a view-through  conversion, despite the user never  actually seeing the ad. These two types of conversions are part of a larger and broader field of online advertising and marketing  known as attribution, which takes into account a number of different interactions a visitor has with a brand or  ad. Apart from there being different types of conversions, there are also different conversion-tracking methods:  138",564,98,141.0
242,132,"The Pixel Method  The pixel method for click-through tracking works like this:  In the pixel method for click-through conversions, the user visits a website, sees an ad and clicks on it. They  are then taken to the advertiser’s landing page and convert. When the user clicks on the ad, the advertiser’s  conversion pixel fires and records the user’s cookie ID in the advertiser’s ad server. Typically, an ad server will assume that the last click ID for the particular cookie ID generated the conversion. 139",508,89,127.0
243,133,"This way, the conversion can be associated with a specific ad, line item, and campaign (the click ID will store  information about which ad the user clicked). The pixel method for view-through tracking:  In the pixel method for view-through conversions, the user sees an ad (but doesn’t click on it), leaves the  publisher’s website, comes back to the advertiser’s website through another channel (e.g. via a Google  search), and then converts. The advertiser is able to attribute the conversion to the ad that was on the publisher’s website by comparing  the cookie ID it created when it displayed the ad on the publisher’s site with the one created when the  conversion pixel fired on the success page. The Server-Side Method  The server-side method works in a similar way to the pixel method; however, instead of firing a pixel and  passing the user’s cookie ID to the ad server, the user’s cookie ID is passed from the page to the ad server via  a server-to-server call. 140",978,175,244.5
244,134,"This method is widely used in the affiliate advertising and marketing space because it is so crucial to get the  data right and reliably track the conversions for the partners (i.e. publishers) because they get paid only for  conversions. Below are a couple examples to help explain the server-side method:  Example 1: Selling insurance as an affiliate  Affiliate advertisers and marketers are paid on a cost-per-action/acquisition (CPA) basis, which means they  only receive payment, either in the form of a fixed-priced commission or a percentage of the sale’s total value,  when a user converts. However, it could be hours, days or even weeks between the time a user sees the insurance ad on the  publisher’s site and the time they actually convert (purchase the insurance policy). Therefore, the system on the advertiser’s side must track the click ID and notify the affiliate ad network (or the  ad server) about the successful conversion once the conversion is verified – e.g. when the application is  processed successfully or when payment from the user is received. Example 2: App installs  Attributing a conversion for an app install to a publisher or affiliate advertiser/marketer is different than  attributing conversions in browsers.",1246,208,311.5
245,134,"The reason for this is because, unlike web and mobile browsers that are  able to fire pixels, there is no way to fire a pixel in a mobile app. In order to track events such as conversions, the software-development kit (SDK) in the app has to notify the  ad server of the installation, which is then attributed to the app-store redirect generated by the partner (i.e.  publisher or affiliate). A postback notification is sent to notify the publisher or affiliate about the successful install, meaning they have  just earned a CPA commission. The Importance of Properly Attributing Affiliate Campaigns  As you can probably imagine, trust is an issue that often arises with CPA campaigns. There are a few ways advertisers can evade paying commissions to publishers and affiliates, but this ultimately  disadvantages the advertiser as well as the publisher or affiliate.",866,147,216.5
246,134,"Let us explain. In the affiliate, CPA, and revenue-sharing space, publishers can ultimately choose from hundreds of offers to  promote. The publisher’s and affiliate’s goal is to make the most money possible from the offers they promote, so most  of them will test the offers on a small percentage of their traffic and tweak them to find the ones that generate  the most revenue. 141",383,68,95.75
247,135,"If the offers don’t perform well, which could be due to a number of reasons (such as offers not being the right fit  for their audience), they will simply remove them from their site and stop promoting them, which means the  advertiser won’t receive any conversions from the offers. This essentially defeats the point of the whole process. Reporting  The reporting function of an AdTech platform is responsible for displaying metrics about many different areas of  a campaign. The reports are highly valuable for both advertisers and publishers, as they provide clear insights into the  performance of their campaigns and the users who click on their ads. For every impression served, an AdTech platform stores a record with the following attributes:  ● Timestamp (impression, click, conversion)  ● IP address  ● Campaign ID  ● Line item ID  ● Ad/creative ID  ● Geolocation  ● Browser  ● OS  ● Publisher domain  ● Publisher placement  ● … and others  Similar information is stored for every click and conversion.",1012,181,253.0
248,136,"Metrics  A metric is an actual number calculated for the overall campaign or the data matching the specific dimension’s  value. Some metrics can be derived from others; for example, calculating the CTR metric is done by dividing the total  number of clicks (metric) by the total number of impressions (metric):  CTR = clicks / impressions x 100. Examples of metrics include:  ● Impressions: the number of times an ad was displayed. ● Clicks: The number of times an ad was clicked on. ● Conversions: the number of desired actions (goals) performed by a user (e.g. filling in a contact form  or making a purchase).",612,110,153.0
249,136,"● Reach: the number of unique visitors/devices that the campaign reached. ● Click-through rate (CTR): number of clicks / number of impressions x 100. ● Cost per mille (CPM): cost per 1,000 impressions. ● Cost per click (CPC): the cost of each click an ad or link generates. ● Cost per action/acquisition (CPA): the cost of each action, acquisition, or conversion.",363,61,90.75
250,136,CPA is often  used in affiliate marketing. ● Conversion rate (CVR): the number of conversions divided by the number of clicks (then multiplied by  100 to get a percentage). This model is typically used for click-through conversions. 143,236,40,59.0
251,137,"● Amount spent (cost): the amount of money spent for the respective impressions, clicks and  conversions. ● Revenue (total conversion value): the amount of money earned from the conversions. Effective Cost Per Mille, Click, and Action (eCPM, eCPC, eCPA)  In most reports, you’ll see metrics that have the letter e before them. The e stands for effective and is used to determine the revenue generated by a particular pricing model (e.g.  eCPM). Effective CPM, CPC, and CPA can be calculated for any campaign and can be worked out by using the  following formulas:  Effective cost per click (eCPC) = budget spend / number of clicks  Effective cost per action/acquisition (eCPA) = budget spend / number of conversions  Effective cost per mille (eCPM) = budget spend / number of impressions x 1000  As advertisers and publishers select a pricing model before the campaign starts, these pricing models show  advertisers and publishers what the results would have been if they had used that particular pricing model.",1011,173,252.75
252,137,"Very often, advertisers will calculate their campaigns in different pricing models to compare their performance. On the publisher’s side, they may want to calculate the eCPC or eCPA for all their CPM campaigns to see if  they could have made more revenue via those pricing models. For example, let’s have a look at the following three campaigns:  Campaign #1: CPM  Campaign  Impressio  ns  Clicks  Conversio  ns  Total cost  CPM  eCPC  eCPA  Summer  promotion  1,000,000  1,500  10  $4,000  $4  $2.67  $400  Campaign #2: CPC  Campaign  Impressio  ns  Clicks  Conversio  ns  Total cost  eCPM  CPC  eCPA  Summer  promotion  2  1,000,000  2,000  50  $10,000  $10  $5  $200  Campaign #3: CPA  144",692,152,173.0

In performance-based advertising, advertisers will look at the return on investment (ROI) of the campaign and  traffic source. This metric is used to evaluate the efficiency of their advertising budget. It is calculated in the following way:  ROI = (total conversion value – amount spent) / amount spent x 100%  The ROI metric will have positive values when the advertiser is making money and negative values when the  advertiser is losing money. Example:  Total conversion  value  Amount spent  ROI  Campaign 1  $1,200  $1,000  +20%  For every dollar  spent, we earn 20  cents*  Campaign 2  $900  $1,000  -10%  For every dollar  spent, we lose 10  cents*  *This does not take into account any fixed or variable costs that you may have with delivering goods or  services to the end customers, so even a 20% ROI may not necessarily mean that you make profit – however,  this works very well with digital goods where your marginal cost is very low.",1165,237,291.25
254,138,Dimension and Subdimensions  A dimension is an attribute or variable of data used to break down a report. Some examples of dimensions include:  ● Country  ● Device type  ● Browser type  ● Hour of the day  ● Campaign  ● Line item  ● Creative  145,245,53,61.25
255,139,"● Date, day of the week  ● Publisher URL/domain  ● OS and OS version  ● Geolocation  Subdimensions (aka drill-downs ) allow us to view data from a given dimension that’s broken down by  another dimension (e.g. Country -> Carrier -> Line item -> Ad). Filtering  Filtering (aka segmentation ) allows you to restrict the data set that you are running the report on. Common filters include:  ● Date range  ● Advertiser -> Insertion Order -> Line Item -> Ad  On top of that, you can typically apply an include/exclude filter for any value for any dimension, e.g.:  ● Country = Poland OR Germany OR United Kingdom  ● Device type = Tablet  ● Day of week = Monday-Friday  Technical Considerations of Reporting  From an ad-operations perspective, there are some important aspects of reporting that need to be  acknowledged, otherwise the advertiser or publisher could be confused and misled when comparing data from  other systems. Delays  There is usually a delay between the time an event is received by the system and the time it’s included in the  reports. Most of the time, it is a few minutes, but sometimes, it can be as high as a couple of hours.",1145,216,286.25
256,139,"The most recent data is often an approximation of a complete report, and an accurate report is available after  some time. It’s best to check these values for the reporting system that you are using. An example of a data delay:  Report-data approximation is available within 15 minutes of an event occurrence, with an accurate report  available within a maximum of 24 hours. Typically, the accurate report should be used for billing purposes. Reporting Time Zone  When comparing reports from different systems, it is important to determine whether they are both using the  same time zone and that only accurate data is used (not an approximation).",647,111,161.75
257,139,Data Retention  Some reporting systems handle the increase in data by dropping events older than some threshold age (e.g.  six months or one year). An alternative space and cost-saving technique is to decrease report granularity with  146,238,40,59.5

Discrepancies: Trust, But Verify  In online advertising, a discrepancy is the difference between reported data in two different AdTech platforms –  e.g. between a publisher’s ad server and an advertiser’s ad server. It is a very sensitive topic because the data collected by these AdTech platforms is later used for billing  purposes and is often subject of disputes between publishers, advertisers, and AdTech vendors. While there can be a number of reasons for discrepancies, most can be attributed to technical errors.",754,131,188.5
259,140,"A majority of AdTech platforms depend on client-side tracking methods – i.e. those carried out in web  browsers, SDKs in mobile apps, and other embedded devices – for receiving data about events, such as  impressions, clicks, and conversions.

In this section, we’ll answer the following questions:  ● How can one verify whether a publisher’s ad server or an advertiser’s ad server reports are valid? ● Why are discrepancies inevitable? ● What are the common causes of discrepancies?",574,98,143.5

When counting the click:  A discrepancy could occur if the redirect chain is broken, which would mean that the advertiser’s ad server  wouldn’t receive information about the click and the user wouldn’t be taken to the final landing page.

Discrepancies and Common Causes  Below are some possible reasons as to why discrepancies occur. Human and Implementation Errors  AdOps are usually swamped with a lot of ad trafficking and last-minute entries.",641,107,160.25
263,142,"It’s not uncommon for agencies  to send or change tags at the last minute before the campaign goes live. Add to this the manual work that must be performed for each of the campaigns, and it’s easy to make a  mistake, especially by a junior or overloaded AdOps team member. Specifically, common errors are:  Pasting an incomplete impression-tracking pixel that’s missing the full ID: Launching an incorrect pixel  will result in hitting the advertiser’s ad server, but not tracking the impression due to the missing ad or  campaign identifier. 149",546,95,136.5
264,143,"Using the incorrect impression pixel: For example, pasting an impression pixel from Campaign ABC to  Campaign 123 that was kept in the pastebin. Implementing the wrong macro: Failing to add a cache buster may cause the pixel to be cached by the  browser and therefore won’t correctly report impressions for subsequent ad views of the same user/browser. Difference in run dates or failure to fully set up the campaign on one of the ad servers: The campaign  may have already started in one ad server, but may not be running in the other ad server, which would cause  the campaign to not display ads. For example, if the tags weren’t properly set up in the advertiser’s ad server, but were set up correctly in the  publisher’s, then the publisher’s tags would run properly on their site and track every impression of the empty  ad. Configuration Issues  Discrepancies in reporting can also be caused by differences in the reporting configuration between different  AdTech platforms, such as:  Time zone: If one AdTech platform records events in Central Time (CT) and another one in Pacific Time (PT),  then you’ll notice disprecencies when looking at time-based dimensions (e.g. daily and hourly reports).",1203,208,300.75
265,143,"Traffic validation and filtering: Some AdTech platforms use traffic validation and filtering services in an  attempt to block fraudulent traffic, which can also cause discrepancies between platforms. Differences in terminology and counting methodology: While most AdTech platforms can agree on the  proper definition of common metrics like impressions, clicks, and conversions, there can be some differences  in how these are counted. For example, one AdTech platform could count impressions when the pixel fires in the browser, whereas  another could count impressions when the ad is served (i.e. when it leaves the server). In the latter case, an  impression would be counted when it is served, but it might not actually load in the browser due to technical  issues. Client-Side Issues  As we mentioned above, most AdTech platforms rely on client-side tracking for reporting, but often encounter a  number of technical issues, such as:  ● Poor Internet connectivity and latency.",980,158,245.0
266,143,"● JavaScript errors could be breaking the execution of the ad code. ● The browser could be set to disable JavaScript or use extensions like <noscript>. ● The URL’s maximum length could have been reached, meaning some redirect paths could be cut off  and not executed. ● Special characters passed in the URL might not be parsed correctly by the AdTech platform. ● The creative’s file size could be too big or might not comply with the IAB’s standards.",450,80,112.5
267,143,"● The webpage could contain large files (e.g. rich images that take a long time to load), which increases  overall latency. 150",127,23,31.75
268,144,"How to Calculate an Impression Discrepancy  Calculating a discrepancy between two AdTech platforms can be done via the following formula:  Impression discrepancy = (publisher’s impression count – advertiser’s impression count) / advertiser’s  impression count  To work out the percentage, simply multiply the final number by 100. Discrepancy Tolerance  The IAB states that a tolerance of 10% discrepancy based on the publisher’s figures is acceptable. 151",455,70,113.75
269,145,"A discrepancy is calculated from the advertiser’s numbers, but if it’s less than 10%, then the publisher’s metric  is typically used for billing. Reconciliation  Reconciliation is a process used to compare two sets of records to ensure the figures are in agreement and  are accurate. Due to the wide-ranging number of possible reasons for discrepancies, most of the time reconciliation is a  manual process whereby AdOps team members log in to their AdTech platform accounts, compile reports,  download the data, and look at where the main problems lie. Chapter Summary  ● The most popular method of counting an impression is to serve a 1×1 transparent image that notifies  the ad server of an impression, known as an impression tracker (or impression pixel ). ● When the impression tracker loads, it records an impression in the AdTech platform.",846,144,211.5
270,145,"● Tracking the number of clicks an ad receives is typically done via a click tracker , which is the URL of  the ad server’s redirect service that counts the click and redirects the visitor to the final landing page of  the campaign. ● A conversion is registered every time a user completes a goal set by an advertiser or marketer, which  could be a purchase or a download. ● There are two main types of conversion tracking: click-through conversion and view-through  conversion, which can either be recorded by firing a pixel on the confirmation page or by tracking the  conversions server-side. 152",599,108,149.75
271,146,"● The reporting function of an AdTech platform is responsible for displaying metrics, dimensions, and  subdimensions about many different areas of a campaign. ● Discrepancies, which are the difference between the reported numbers of two different AdTech  platforms, are common in AdTech and there can be many reasons why they occur. Common reasons  are related to human error, reporting configuration, and technical issues. ● The IAB states that a discrepancy of under 10% is acceptable. 153",491,79,122.75
272,147,"09. Media-Buying Methods: Programmatic, Real-Time  Bidding (RTB), Header Bidding, and PMP  As we’ve covered previously in this book, the online advertising industry is made up of many advertising  technology platforms, such as ad servers, DSPs, SSPs and ad networks. The goals of these AdTech platforms vary – some are responsible for serving ads, while others are designed to  help advertisers and publishers buy and sell online media. In this chapter, we’ll take a look at the media-buying processes that power these AdTech platforms. 154",540,88,135.0
273,148,"The Main Media-Buying Processes  Below is an overview of the main media-buying processes that we’ll be covering in this chapter:  Now let’s take a look at these processes in more detail. Manual Media Buying  In the early days of online advertising, the buying and selling of ads between advertisers and publishers was a  very manual process. Advertisers would work with publishers and send them ad tags directly. Because there weren’t any  technological platforms involved, there wasn’t any way to define targeting or produce reports. Luckily, the introduction of ad servers solved this and kickstarted the programmatic media-buying revolution.",644,103,161.0
274,148,"Programmatic Media Buying  What Does Programmatic Mean? The term programmatic can mean different things to different people, but here’s a simple and clear definition:  155",171,27,42.75
275,149,"Programmatic refers to the use of technology, algorithms and data to buy and sell online media in an  automated fashion. Compare this to the manual way of buying advertising, which doesn’t involve the use of technology or  algorithms and is done human to human. Below are some examples that illustrate the difference between the execution processes of manually  purchased media and programmatically purchased media:  Manual media buying  The execution of a manual media transaction:  ● The advertiser and the publisher sign an insertion order (IO), which is a contract that defines the terms  and conditions of the campaign, such as flight dates and placement. ● The advertiser sends its ad tags to the publisher. These ad tags are pieces of HTML that will display the  ad on the publisher’s website.",800,138,200.0
276,150,"Programmatic media buying  The execution of a programmatic media transaction:  ● The advertiser and the publisher sign an insertion order (IO), which is a contract that defines the terms  and conditions of the campaign, such as flight dates and placement. ● The advertiser’s AdOps team configures the campaign in the advertiser’s ad server and sends the ad  tags to the publisher. ● The publisher’s AdOps team sets up the campaign, adds the advertiser’s ad tags to the publisher’s ad  server and starts the campaign. Although the above processes look similar, the main advantage of using ad servers is the added benefits they  provide over manual media buying, such as targeting, placement, reporting, and the elimination of mundane  and repetitive tasks. For example, instead of a publisher adding the advertiser’s ad tag on its website that would simply display the  ad when the page loads, the ad tag could instead redirect to the advertiser’s ad server.",957,163,239.25
277,150,"The benefit of this is  that the ad server could then decide which ad to show the user based on a number of factors, such as location  and device. 157",150,32,37.5
278,151,"Another key difference between manually purchasing and programmatically purchasing media is the speed  with which we can start and modify the campaign when it’s running. Creating and launching a campaign in a programmatic AdTech platform such as a DSP takes a matter of  minutes. Without programmatic technologies, it can take several days before the campaign begins. Also, when buying media manually without programmatic platforms, each change to the campaign has to go  through the publisher’s AdOps team, which can take a few days to implement. When tweaking the campaign in  programmatic media-buying platforms, changes made by the AdOps are reflected close to real time.",675,108,168.75
279,151,"This becomes very important, as brands have to react fast to any changes and optimizing a campaign can be  done on an hourly or daily basis. Campaign Optimization Basics: Manual vs. Algorithms  Campaign optimization involves making changes to the campaign in order to improve its performance and  make media buys more economical. There are a number of areas that can be changed in a campaign, such as the targeting criteria and the ads  themselves. Campaigns can be optimized either manually or via algorithms. Manual optimization  Manual optimization typically involves advertisers adjusting their CPC, CPA and CPM bids, usually on a daily  basis.",648,108,162.0
280,151,"Basically, an advertiser uses data broken down by all the different dimensions provided by the ad platform,  such as geolocation, gender, interests, device type, etc.,and uses those dimensions to extend or limit targeting  to specific groups. By doing so, the advertiser creates very specific targeting criteria that provides the most optimal CTR, CPA or  conversion rate. In order to make the optimizations, advertisers utilize data to determine which bids to adjust, including:  ● The ads’ CTRs  ● The number of clicks generated by the ads  ● The number of impressions generated by the ads  Below is a process media buyers could use to manually optimize a campaign:  ● Start by breaking down the data by one or more dimensions, such as geolocation, device, publisher  domain, time of day, carrier, etc. ● Filter out non-significant data.",839,144,209.75
281,151,"For example, only ads that generate a few impressions or clicks, or filter  by significant data, such as ads that generate the most impressions or clicks. ● See the best- and worst-performing values, such as device type or geolocation. 158",239,41,59.75
282,152,"● Also, you could view certain metrics, depending on what you want to optimize. Examples could include  the effective cost per mille (eCPM) of an ebook download or something lower in your sales or marketing  funnel, such as cost per qualified lead. ● Blacklist the areas (i.e. exclude from targeting) that are underperforming or not performing at all. There are a number of other techniques an advertiser could use to optimize a campaign, including:  ● Running A/B tests: Making changes to the creatives and running tests to see which variant performs  better. ● Personalizing the creatives (dynamic creatives): Changing the messaging or visual aspects of the  creatives to make them more relevant for different segments.",721,120,180.25
283,152,"Examples can include adding a city name  to the creatives so that it matches the user’s location. ● Experimenting with different traffic sources: Seeing how different sources (e.g. websites), mediums  (e.g. display and video ads) and AdTech platforms perform by experimenting with a small percentage of  an advertiser’s budget (5-10%) and compare metrics like the eCPA, eCPM, etc.,against one another. Automated optimization  Automated optimization involves using algorithms to power the optimization process. Many AdTech platforms have built-in algorithms that deliver some sort of automated optimization functionality.",620,90,155.0
284,152,"The key component of successful automated optimization is historical data. The algorithms are only able to  make decisions and optimizations if they have the proper amount and quality of data to fuel them. Programmatic Direct  Programmatic direct (aka programmatic guaranteed, programmatic reserved, automated guaranteed) is a  method of buying and selling media, but unlike RTB, no auctions are held. Instead, an advertiser and publisher agree on the inventory and the CPM, then the rest of the process is  handled programmatically via the use of AdTech platforms. Programmatic direct is very similar to the way media was bought and sold prior to the Internet and even in the  early days of online advertising, but provides more scale thanks to the use of advertising technology.",780,128,195.0
285,153,"The programmatic-direct process is similar to placing an order on an ecommerce platform, but instead of  buying a product, you are buying media inventory. The process looks like this:  ● An advertiser browses through catalogs of websites. ● It chooses placements, flight dates and the volume of impressions. ● It configures creatives and additional tracking pixels. ● It places an order on the platform.",403,66,100.75
286,153,"● The publisher audits and verifies the campaign. ● The order is executed without additional involvement from the AdOps team, except for an audit, which it  carries out. The main advantage of programmatic direct is the ability to secure premium inventory at a premium price. Although programmatic direct means advertisers may need to pay higher CPMs compared to other  media-buying processes (such as RTB), they are able to secure premium inventory before the ad space is  offered on an open RTB auction. This allows them to reach their target audience when they otherwise might  not have been able to.",602,103,150.5
287,153,"For publishers, this results in higher CPMs. The main disadvantage of programmatic direct for advertisers is that there are less targeting options available,  as they are simply displaying ads based on the context and known audience of a website. For example, a bank could show an ad about its new bank account on a financial website. Compare that to RTB, where the same bank could show the same ad across many different websites only to  people who had visited its website. 160",478,84,119.5
288,154,"For publishers, the main disadvantage is that they may not be able to sell all of their inventory via  programmatic direct. However, many publishers set up a waterfall to ensure they sell as much inventory as  they can. More on this below. Real-Time Bidding (RTB)  The mid-to-late ‘90s saw a number of ad networks emerge, so much so that by the mid-2000s there were  hundreds of ad networks on the market. However, ad networks soon found themselves falling victim to either underfilling or overfilling ad campaigns.",515,90,128.75
289,154,"Publishers soon realized that their ad network wasn’t selling all of their available inventory, so they started  working with more ad networks. However, this meant adding more tags to their websites, which lead to latency  issues and a poor user experience. To combat the latency issues, a new type of platform emerged, supply-side platforms (SSPs) , originally  referred to as network optimizers. The first supply-side platforms (SSPs)  161",441,72,110.25
290,155,"The first SSPs to hit the market were Collective, Pubmatic , Admeld , and Magnite (formerly The Rubicon  Project). Instead of adding multiple tags to a website, publishers included just one tag that redirected to an SSP. From there, the SSP worked out which ad networks were interested in purchasing the publisher’s inventory  and then finalized the transaction. The mid-to-late 2000s not only saw the rise of SSPs, but also demand-side platforms (DSPs) . DSPs emerged as a way for media buyers (advertisers and agencies) to connect to publishers’ inventory  offered through SSPs.",580,96,145.0
291,155,"The first demand-side platforms (DSPs)  The first DSPs that emerged were Invite Media (now part of the Google Marketing Platform ), dataxu , and  MediaMath . Around the same time, the next revolutionary AdTech platform to hit the online display advertising industry was  the ad exchange . Ad exchanges emerged as a way to help solve the liquidity issues by auctioning off a publisher’s inventory on  an impression-by-impression basis. 162",438,74,109.5
292,156,"The ad exchange handles the buying and selling of media between an advertiser and publisher. The easiest way to explain how ad exchanges operate is to compare them to the stock exchange. In the same way stock exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of stocks, bonds and other securities, ad  exchanges handle the buying and selling of ad impressions between advertisers and publishers in real time. 163",406,68,101.5
293,157,"Did you know? In 2007, the three largest ad exchanges – DoubleClick, AdECN and RightMedia – were all bought by  Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!respectively. This ability to buy and sell individual impressions in real time is known as real-time bidding (RTB) . What Is Real-Time Bidding (RTB)?",290,48,72.5
294,157,"Real-time bidding (RTB) is a protocol that was introduced in the late 2000s and was a big game changer for  the way online media was bought and sold. Originally designed to help publishers sell remnant inventory to advertisers, RTB is now used to sell all types of  inventory, including premium inventory. Instead of buying thousands of impressions from the same publisher, RTB allows advertisers to purchase  individual impressions across multiple publishers to reach their target audience more precisely and bid based  on the information known about the website and user at that particular time. Publishers also benefit by receiving higher CPMs for their inventory. What is the RTB Project (OpenRTB)?",702,114,175.5
295,157,"The RTB Project, formerly known as the OpenRTB Consortium and now referred to as OpenRTB , is a group  led by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, consisting of AdTech companies from both the demand and supply  sides. Started in November 2010, OpenRTB provides AdTech vendors with an API specification. This protocol  (known as the OpenRTB protocol) allows platforms to communicate between one another using a common  language to buy and sell digital media. How Does RTB Work? The technical side of RTB is highly complex and involves multiple AdTech platforms.",559,93,139.75
296,158,"A detailed look at how the RTB process works. ● A user visits a page (example.com). ● The page contains an ad slot with JavaScript code that requests content from the first-party ad server,  known as an ad request. The request also passes additional data about the user, such as their location,  device type and operating system. ● The ad server checks if there are any direct campaigns matching the user.",405,73,101.25
297,158,"If not, the ad server returns  the SSP’s ad tag, which will offer the impression on an RTB auction. ● The browser loads the script contained in the SSP ad tag from the server. User information and  placement details like page URL, size, and restrictions are passed to the ad exchange. ● The ad exchange announces the available ad impression to all bidders via a bid request. ● Bidders evaluate the bid request and match targeting parameters, such as page domain, context,  location and other data collected about the user.",522,93,130.5
298,158,"They then place their bids – basically, they state how  much they want to pay for this impression, if anything. They also send the markup of the ad that they  would like to display. The bid price and ad markup are enclosed in an object called the bid response. ● The ad exchange receives the bids and the impression goes to the highest bidder. The highest bidder  pays the price of the second-highest bid, plus an additional small amount (usually $0.01).",454,84,113.5
299,158,"This is known  as a second-price auction. A win notice containing the final price sends from the ad exchange to the  winning DSP, which is done via a server-to-server request or through the ad markup via a pixel with a  price macro that’s filled in automatically by the ad exchange. The winning DSP’s ad markup is sent to  the browser. 165",339,65,84.75
300,159,"● The DSP’s ad markup loads in the browser and sends a request to retrieve the creative (ad) from the  DSP’s ad server. It is quite common for the ad markup to request the creative from a content-delivery  network (CDN) instead of directly from the ad server. An impression-tracking pixel also fires, which  notifies the ad server that an impression has been served. ● The DSP’s ad server sends the creative to the browser and the ad displays to the user. This entire process happens in real time when an ad is loaded onto the page, usually within 100–150  milliseconds .",571,105,142.75
301,159,"To put that in perspective, it takes about 300 milliseconds to blink! Each time a page is loaded or refreshed, a new ad request is sent from the page, which subsequently starts a  new RTB auction. What Information Do Bid Requests and Bid Responses Contain? Bid requests and bid responses typically use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for its human  readability and compactness. Here’s an example of part of a bid request from the IAB’s OpenRTB 2.5 specification :  166",477,83,119.25
302,160,"Here’s an example of a bid response:  The OpenRTB specifications list dozens of objects (e.g. BidRequest, Source, and Device) and object  attributes. These objects and object attributes help DSPs decide whether an impression is worth bidding on and relay  other pieces of information to the advertiser via the DSP. Here’s a list of some of the main OpenRTB objects and their attributes:  Imp (impression)  ● id  ● banner  ● video  ● audio  ● native  Banner  ● w (width)  ● h (height)  Video  ● minduration (minimum duration of video ad)  ● maxduration (maximum duration of video ad)  ● skip (denotes whether the ad can be skipped)  167",635,123,158.75

These changes can be made manually by the advertiser or by a  DSP’s algorithms. Fraudulent-inventory recognition: Because advertisers have real-time campaign reports, it’s easier to detect  fraudulent activity, such as extremely high click-through rates. Many RTB platforms incorporate ad-fraud  prevention and detection software to help advertisers reduce ad waste. For Publishers  Increased revenue: RTB opens a publisher’s inventory to dozens, even hundreds, of advertisers, which  results in better campaign matching and higher CPMs.",757,115,189.25
305,162,"Optimized price floors: In the same way advertisers use real-time analytics to improve their campaigns,  publishers can also use real-time analytics to adjust their inventory’s CPM floor price to increase revenue. Transparency Issues Regarding Commissions and Viewability in the RTB Ecosystem  Back in the day when the movement of media between the advertiser and publisher was a purely direct  process, both parties knew how much the media was being sold and purchased for. While this direct process is still occurring today, the benefits offered by technology platforms (DSPs, SSPs,  DMPs, etc.)are leading to an increase in programmatic media buying for both remnant and premium inventory. However, even though these platforms are providing advertisers and publishers with an easier and more  optimized way of buying and selling media, they have essentially become the middlemen and are making the  true cost of media harder to identify.",940,150,235.0
306,162,"When an advertiser makes a media purchase with its agency, it is often unaware of how many hands its  budget passes through, and how many commissions are paid to the intermediaries and technology platforms  before it reaches the user. It is not uncommon for an ad to pass through five different parties before it reaches the publisher. That’s up to  five middlemen all taking different commissions and charging their own fees. 169",430,75,107.5
307,163,"Intermediary Commissions and Fees  Knowing exactly how much commission each technology platform takes (DSP, Ad Exchange, SSP) is  extremely hard to calculate, and even if this information is passed on to the advertiser, it can be more difficult  to validate and confirm. However, a 2020 report by PwC and the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) titled the  Programmatic Supply Chain Transparency Study found that, on average, publishers received just 51% of ad  spent, with 35% going to the intermediaries, e.g. ad agencies and AdTech companies. The report also found  that 15% of that ad spend, known as the unknown delta, couldn’t be accounted for. Some of the key highlights from the report are:  ● Demand-side tech fees, such as ad serving, verification tools and data, averaged to account for 10% of  advertiser spend. ● SSP fees worked out to be, on average, 14% of publisher revenues, which is equivalent to about 8% of  advertiser spend.",960,165,240.0
308,163,"● The percentage of ad spend that publishers receive ranged from 49% to 67%. A 2014 industry study conducted by PwC and sponsored by the IAB also found that around 50% of an  advertiser’s media budget went to fees and commissions. We consistently heard throughout our conversations with industry executives that programmatic ad tech fees  are substantial – generally close to 50% or more. These ad tech fees were often referred to as the “ad tech  tax” in our conversations. Ad tech tax in this context refers to the fees imposed on buyers and sellers for  leveraging ad tech technology, and/or value adds from ATDs, DSPs, SSPs, ad servers and ad networks.",656,116,164.0
309,163,"In  many instances, these fees get compounded as fees from one supplier get added to the costs of the next  supplier in the programmatic value chain. [1] IAB Programmatic Revenue Report 2014 Results: An industry study conducted by PwC and sponsored by the Interactive Advertising Bureau  (IAB). July 2015. The study went on to state that the percentage varies among companies and may be lower depending on the  number of AdTech platforms an advertiser uses to run media campaigns. For example, an advertiser using just one DSP to purchase media through an ad exchange would likely pay  fewer fees than one who uses an ad agency, which uses an ATD and DSP to purchase media from an ad  exchange.",694,125,173.5
310,163,"In the current programmatic system, advertisers are only informed about the price of the media in relation to  the quantity (e.g. $10 for 1,000 impressions = CPM), but they have no way of finding out what percentage of  that will be taken by the technology platform and what percentage the publisher will actually receive. 170",326,57,81.5
311,164,"In addition to the main platforms and intermediaries, advertisers may also pay for third-party data (e.g.  behavioral and demographic verification data) from a data-management platform (DMP) as well as additional  services (viewability, brand-safety verification, etc). While the cost of the data is usually known to the advertiser, the DSP may add some hidden margins to its  price. Where Does the Industry Go From Here? There is no doubt that lack of transparency is an issue that needs immediate attention. One way to start is to  educate advertisers on the inner workings of various technology platforms and highlight the value they provide.",645,105,161.25
312,164,"Thankfully, many AdTech vendors are becoming more transparent about their fees and commissions. Private Marketplace (PMP)  Although RTB helped publishers sell their remnant inventory on the open market, many premium publishers  found that they were losing money on their most premium inventory. Advertisers also became concerned that they were missing out on premium inventory and their ads weren’t  even seen by visitors. To overcome these issues, private marketplace (PMP) was born. Private marketplace is an invite-only variation of the RTB model where publishers offer their most premium  inventory to a select number of buyers.",632,98,158.0
313,164,Advertisers participating in PMP deals can bid on the available inventory before the publisher offers it in an  open RTB auction. 171,133,23,33.25

Now that we’ve covered the main ways media can be bought and sold, we’ll look at two processes that  publishers can use to manage and organize the above media-buying methods. The Publisher’s Waterfall  Waterfalling, also known as a daisy chain or waterfall tags , is a process used by a publisher to sell all  remnant inventory. This process occurs when a publisher has been unable to sell its premium ad slots that are  usually reserved for direct ad sales between the publisher’s internal sales team and advertisers. Waterfalling gets its name from the waterfall-like process for selling inventory; the demand sources are initiated  one at a time, one after another.",1988,372,497.0
316,166,"The advantage of this daisy chain is that the publisher is able to sell off its inventory; however, as the  impressions go further down the waterfall, the CPM price, which is worked out as an average, decreases. The Publisher’s Dilemma: High CPM or High Fill Rate? While ad networks allow publishers to sell their remnant inventory, they still face what’s known as the  publisher’s dilemma – should they sell their inventory at a high CPM and risk not filling all of their available  ad slots, missing out on revenue opportunities?Or should they fill all of their inventory and receive less CPM  for their ad slots, missing out on potentially higher revenue opportunities? 173",676,117,169.0
317,167,"The image above illustrates the risks and rewards of selling inventory on different ad networks. In the image above, we can see the publisher first tries to sell its inventory via direct sales, as these generally  offer the highest cost-per mille (CPM). If it is unable to do so, the publisher will then pass the impression to SSPs and ad exchanges and aim to sell  the impression in an open RTB auction. If the ad space is still unsold, it will pass the impression to an ad  network. How Is Waterfalling Implemented?",517,95,129.25
318,167,"The AdOps team sets up an ad network with a tracking tag that will execute if and when an impression is not  filled. This is typically configured in the publisher’s ad server as well as in each ad network’s system that the  publisher works with in a field called Fallback Ads, Passbacks, Redirects, Default Ads , or similar. These passbacks will need to be configured for each ad network used by the publisher. Referring to the image  above, the publisher’s AdOps team would configure the premium ad network to “passback” to the remnant  ad network . How Does Waterfalling Work?",578,104,144.5
319,167,"If a publisher is unable to sell its direct buys, its ad server executes the first ad network’s tag. There are a couple of possible outcomes, so let’s take a look at a few likely scenarios. Scenario 1  174",205,40,51.25
320,168,"A direct deal with advertiser #1 is able to offer an impression for this ad call, so it sends an ad back to the  user’s browser. Scenario 2  The publisher’s direct deals doesn’t have an impression to offer, so it loads the tag to hold RTB auctions  with ad exchange #1 and #2 , which also don’t have an impression to offer, so it loads the ad tag for remnant  ad networks #1 , which is able to offer an impression for this ad request. The impression is then sent to the user’s browser and the ad is displayed. 175",513,104,128.25
321,169,"Why didn’t any of the direct deals or RTB sources buy the inventory? There are a couple of possible reasons why these two sources didn’t return an impression. These include:  ● No matching campaigns: It’s possible that the advertiser’s targeting criteria might not have matched  the website or user, meaning the demand source (ad network or DSP) wouldn’t have had a suitable ad  to display. ● High floor price: The publisher’s high floor price might have been higher than what the advertiser was  willing to pay. ● Impression capping: Advertisers set up impression capping to limit the number of times an ad is  shown to a given user, so it’s likely that the ad may have reached its maximum number of impressions  for that given timeframe.",739,132,184.75
322,169,"● Timed out: Another reason is that the advertiser’s ad server, ad network or DSP may have taken too  long to respond to the ad request, meaning it was timed out. If this happens, it wouldn’t send back the  passback ad tag, meaning the waterfall would end and no ads would be displayed. This situation is one  of the main downsides of using the waterfall option. Scenario 3  If all the demand sources don’t offer an impression, the publisher activates its fallback option. In most cases,  this is an ad promoting its own products or services.",542,101,135.5
323,170,"How Does the Ad Server Know Which Ad Network to Load First? Publishers typically set up a ranking system whereby the demand sources are placed from highest average  historical yield to the lowest. The average historical yield is simply the average amount of revenue the demand source has made for the  publisher in the past. The drawback to this system is that some demand sources may be willing to pay a higher price for a given  impression than their average historical yield. For example, a remnant ad network third in the queue may have an average historical yield of $2 CPM, but  may be willing to pay $5 CPM for a given impression if the user meets its targeting criteria.",678,124,169.5
324,170,"This inability of waterfalling to accurately provide a real-time cost of available impressions was one of the  reasons behind the rise of header bidding. Header Bidding  Header bidding (aka pre-bidding, advance bidding, and holistic yield management ) is a media-buying  process that enables publishers to simultaneously collect bids from a number of demand sources (e.g. DSPs)  before their ad server loads other tags, such as direct deals. 177",445,72,111.25
325,171,"The bids are collected via a piece of JavaScript code located in a website’s header section, hence the name  header bidding. Header bidding came about because of the inefficiencies of waterfalling and also because of Google’s  preferences towards its own ad products. Because many publishers use Google’s ad server, formerly known  as DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), Google favored bids from Google Ad Exchange (AdX). This resulted in demand from other AdTech platforms missing out on the chance to purchase the ad space,  even if they wanted to pay a higher amount for it. How Does Header Bidding Work?",605,102,151.25
326,171,"To implement header bidding, publishers need to add a piece of JavaScript code (aka snippet or tag) in  between the <head></head> tags on their website.

330,175,Here’s an overview of how the header-bidding process works:  Here’s what is happening in the image above:  ● A user opens their web browser and types in the publisher’s URL (e.g. publisher.com). ● The browser starts loading the page. ● The header-bidding JavaScript code or wrapper located in the <head> tag executes and sends a  request to the various AdTech platforms (SSPs and ad exchanges). ● The SSPs and ad exchanges send bid requests to multiple DSPs. ● The DSPs analyze the bids and return a bid response if the impression matches their campaigns.,555,97,138.75
331,175,"● The highest bidder wins. ● The bid passes on to the publisher’s ad server and competes with other campaigns, such as direct  deals. ● If the DSP’s bid is higher than the publisher’s other campaigns, it is displayed to the user. Just like other media-buying processes, latency is a big issue with header bidding. 182",317,57,79.25
332,176,"If a DSP, SSP or ad exchange doesn’t respond to the ad or bid request in time, they will be timed out and won’t  be able to submit a bid. The timeout rates vary and are different on desktops, laptops, and mobile. On desktop and laptop computers,  the timeout range is 400–800 milliseconds, and with mobile, it’s 800–1,200 milliseconds.

333,176,"How to Implement Header Bidding: Client Side vs. Server Side  When it comes to implementing header bidding, there are two options: client-side header bidding (CSHB)  and server-side header bidding (SSHB) . Client-side header bidding collects bids directly from the web browser (i.e. the client), whereas server-side  header bidding collects bids from a server. With both CSHB and SSHB, the publisher still needs to add a wrapper or JS snippet to its website. Here’s a side-by-side comparison of how the client-side and server-side header-bidding implementations work:  Below are the main advantages and disadvantages of client-side and server-side header bidding. Advantages of client-side header bidding:  183",710,109,177.5
334,177,"● Cookie-matching rates are higher between AdTech platforms because the process happens in the  browser. ● There’s more control over header-bidding wrappers, meaning publishers can easily add and remove  them. ● There’s greater transparency into the demand sources and clearing prices. Disadvantages of client-side header bidding:  ● Because the header-bidding code is located on the page, it takes longer for the page to load, which  provides a poor user experience. ● There may be some browser-compatibility issues, meaning the header-bidding code may not work  properly on older browsers.",591,93,147.75
335,177,"● Browsers can only make so many requests at one time, meaning the number of requests sent from a  wrapper or tag will be limited to about a dozen or so. Advantages of server-side header bidding:  ● Page-load latency is significantly reduced because one call is made to a server, where all the bidding  takes place on a server, instead of multiple calls being made from the browser. ● Server-side header bidding allows publishers to receive more bids from demand sources, as it doesn’t  have the same technical limitations as client-side. Disadvantages of server-side header bidding:  ● Because the process happens on a server, there’s less control and transparency into things like  clearing prices, demand sources and fees. ● Matching cookies is harder to do with server-side header bidding, which often leads to a drop in  revenue for publishers because there’s no addressability (i.e. advertisers don’t know or can’t identify  the user on the website).",956,163,239.0
336,177,"Waterfall vs. Header Bidding: Benefits and Drawbacks  The table below summarizes the main benefits and drawbacks of both the waterfall method and header bidding  for publishers that want to increase fill rates and maximize yield. Below we summarize the main benefits and drawbacks of both the waterfall method and header bidding for  publishers that want to increase fill rates and maximize yield. Benefits of the Waterfall  ● Sells off remnant inventory that would otherwise be wasted. ● Compared to the header-bidding process, waterfalling is easier to implement and requires less  technical knowledge. In order to implement waterfalling, all the publisher needs to do is set up a tag on  an ad network and in its ad server.",726,123,181.5
337,177,Benefits of Header Bidding  ● Publishers can receive bids from buyers that may be more interested in their inventory (and willing to  pay a higher price) than the buyers connected to the publisher’s ad server. 184,213,38,53.25
338,178,"● The chances of filling all types of available inventory, including both premium and remnant (unsold)  inventory is higher because there are more buyers. ● Publishers are able to get greater insights into inventory value – e.g. if a publisher sets a floor price (the  lowest price it is willing to sell inventory for) of $1.50 CPM, but after utilizing header bidding finds that its  inventory is being sold for an average of $2.00 CPM, then it will get a clearer picture of how much its  inventory is actually worth on the market. Drawbacks of the Waterfall  ● It can produce low yield, as the publisher’s ad server chooses the demand sources based on the  highest average yield, not the current market price of inventory, meaning the price given is the average  CPM, not the true CPM. ● It often causes latency issues, as loading each tier takes time, and the more time passes, the less likely  it is that the user will see the ad. ● Each demand source may fail to load the fallback or become timed out, resulting in lost revenue.",1032,192,258.0
339,178,"● Some demand sources require configuring the passbacks in their system, making it difficult for AdOps  to reconfigure and manage. Drawbacks of Header Bidding  ● While header bidding may reduce the number of passbacks common in waterfall auctions, and thus  improve page-load time, it has a few latency issues of its own (mainly caused by adding more scripts to  a page). The latency issue is much less relevant with server-side heading bidding. ● In order to work efficiently, client-side header bidding has to be backward-compatible with browsers  and, in general, compatible with different browsers. ● If a publisher uses multiple header partners, it runs the risk of putting the same impression or inventory  up for sale, duplicating its bid-processing efforts.",765,126,191.25
340,178,"This drawback relates to both client-side and  server-side header bidding. ● Adding additional logic slows down the performance of the browsers and the website itself, which is not  a big deal on modern hardware, but can be a problem on slightly older hardware and older  smartphones. Auction Dynamics: First- and Second-Price Auctions and Hard and Soft Floor Prices  Auctions are an important part of many different types of transactions. They are used to buy and sell houses,  works of art and products on ecommerce sites like eBay. They are also a key part of buying and selling online  media via RTB transactions.",617,108,154.25
341,178,"Since the beginning of real-time bidding towards the end of the 2000s, the main model used to buy and sell  online media was the second-price auction. Second-Price Auctions (2PA)  During second-price auctions (also known as Vickrey auctions), prospective buyers (advertisers) put forward  their bids. The winner is the highest bidder, but instead of paying the amount they bid, they pay the price put forward by  the second-highest bidder plus $0.01. 185",454,75,113.5
342,179,"The price the buyer pays is known as the clearing price . The difference between the amount the advertiser bid  and the clearing price is known as the reduction, or consumer surplus, which, in the example above, is $0.29. First-Price Auctions (1PA)  With first-price auctions, the highest bidder wins and pays the exact amount they bid. For example, if an  advertiser bids $2.50 CPM and they win the auction, the clearing price will be $2.50 CPM. The online advertising industry has used second-price auctions ever since the RTB model was introduced, but  over the past couple of years (since 2017/2018), many ad exchanges and SSPs have started moving to  first-price auctions.",677,116,169.25
343,179,"The main reasons for this are to counter the impact of header bidding and make auctions more transparent  and fair for advertisers and publishers. Despite the advantages of header bidding, many advertisers were losing out to direct deals, even though their  initial bid was higher. This meant that publishers were missing out on higher CPMs. 186",345,58,86.25
344,180,"Step-by-step explanation:  ● The publisher’s web page loads and a header-bidding request is sent to an SSP/ad exchange. ● The SSP/ad exchange sends a bid request to DSPs. Each DSP returns a bid response with its  respective bid. Because the SSP/ad exchange conducted a second-price auction, the winning DSP  pays $0.01 more than the second-highest bid (DSP #2), which works out to be $4.01. ● The SSP/ad exchange passes DSP #1’s winning bid to the publisher’s ad server.",470,81,117.5
345,180,"This bid will now  compete with a publisher’s direct deals. ● In this case, the direct deal is higher than the bid from DSP #1 ($4.01), so the direct deal wins. ● The ad from the direct deal is sent to the web page and displayed to the visitor. As the diagram above illustrates, the advertiser (represented by DSP #1) missed out on showing its ad to the  visitor even though it was willing to pay more than the direct deal. This is a common pitfall of the second-price  auction model with header bidding.",504,97,126.0
346,181,"Now, because a first-price auction was held between the SSP/ad exchange and the two DSPs, the winning bid  from the header-bidding auction is $6.00 CPM, which is exactly what DSP #1 bid. Because it is higher than the  direct deal, its ad is shown to the visitor. Bid Shading  While the move from second-price auctions to first-price auctions allows advertisers to win more impressions,  they are now having to pay a higher price. If advertisers were bidding $5.00 CPM but winning most impressions for $3.01 on a second-price auction, they  would now be paying $5.00 CPM on a first-price auction. As you can imagine, this has a big impact on media  budgets and spend.",666,120,166.5
347,181,"What’s more, second-price auctions give advertisers a pretty good idea of how much the impressions are  worth, allowing them to change their bids accordingly. With first-price auctions, there’s really no easy way for  advertisers to know this. 188",247,40,61.75
348,182,"To help advertisers optimize their bids during first-price auctions and get them closer to the real cost of the bid,  AdTech companies introduced a feature known as bid shading . Bid shading is essentially an algorithm that aims to tell advertisers how much they should bid on first-price  auctions. It does this by analyzing historical bid data, such as how much the impression was selling for, the ad  position and at what price bids are lost. At the moment, bid shading is offered by supply-side platforms and some demand-side platforms. The reason  for this is because most DSPs haven’t updated their tech to handle first-price auctions.",641,110,160.25
349,182,"Although bid shading helps advertisers save money, it’s not a very transparent practice. It’s quite easy for an AdTech company to tell an advertiser that they should be bidding $3.00 CPM when the  actual impression would sell for $2.00 CPM and then pocket the difference. The only way an advertiser would  know the true cost of an impression would be to obtain data from the SSP, which is not something that  happens in programmatic advertising. While most AdTech vendors offer bid shading as a free feature, there’s talk that many vendors will start  charging for this, which has angered advertisers, as they feel that optimizing their bids should be something  their tech partners offer as standard. Bid shading also leaves publishers with less ad revenue.",758,130,189.5
350,182,"Instead of an advertiser bidding $5.00 CPM and  winning, if they use bid shading and win the bid at $3.00 CPM, that’s money the publisher has missed out on. Floor Prices  The contract between an AdTech vendor and publisher will typically specify a minimum CPM price that the ad  network is to offer its advertisers. This guaranteed CPM price is also called a floor price and is designed to avoid the situation where the  AdTech vendor may discount the publisher’s inventory, which would devalue it in the eyes of advertisers. There are two types of floor prices: hard and soft . Hard price floor  A hard price floor represents the minimum price the publisher will accept for the impressions.",691,124,172.75
351,182,"Any bids below this minimum price are simply ignored, meaning publishers will not accept any bids below the  hard price floor. Soft price floor  Because bidders may not necessarily know what the hard floor is, many publishers set a soft floor price to  “catch” any bids that fall slightly below the publisher’s asking price and that otherwise would get rejected. 189",366,64,91.5
352,184,"Any bids between the hard and soft floor take part in a first-price auction. If there are bids above the soft price  floor, they will take part in a second-price auction. Chapter Summary  ● There are many different ways advertisers can buy online media from publishers, such as:  ○ Direct deals : Deals made directly between a publisher and advertisers. ○ Programmatic direct: An advertiser and publisher agree on the inventory and the CPM, and  the rest of the process is handled programmatically (i.e. via the use of AdTech platforms). ○ Real-time bidding (RTB) : Real-time auctions where advertisers bid on individual impressions  offered by publishers via DSPs, ad exchanges and SSPs.",688,117,172.0
353,184,"○ Private marketplace (PMP): An invite-only version of RTB whereby publisher’s allow certain  advertisers to bid on their inventory before they offer it in an open RTB auction. ● Waterfalling is a process used by a publisher to sell all remnant inventory whereby the publisher’s ad  server calls the demand sources one after another. ● Header bidding is a process that allows publishers to collect bids from multiple demand sources before  their ad server is called, which increases their chances of securing higher CPMs. ● There are two main auction types in RTB:  ○ Second-price auctions, where the winning bid pays the second-highest price plus $0.01. ○ First-price auctions, where the winning bid pays the amount they bid.",726,122,181.5

Different Types of Cookies  For the most part, all cookies are the same. However, there are two main types of cookies: first-party and  third-party cookies .",833,138,208.25
361,188,"The difference has to do with the relationship between the website and the server that created them. First-party cookies are created by the domain (website) a user visits directly. For example, if you visit  techcrunch.com , then it will create some first-party cookies and save them to your device. 195",303,51,75.75
362,189,"First-party cookies are created by the domain the user is visiting. First-party cookies are typically used to deliver a good user experience by remembering specific information  and user preferences. For example, first-party cookies help websites remember the language a user has set and which products  they’ve added to a shopping cart. Also, first-party cookies can allow users to stay logged in to websites and accounts, meaning they don’t have  to log in each time they visit their favorite websites. Although they can be used for online advertising, they are limited in their ability to identify users across  different domains.",633,103,158.25
363,189,"This means that a first-party cookie created by ssp1.com on techcrunch.com can’t be read  by ssp1.com on different websites. In order to overcome this limitation, AdTech companies use third-party cookies and cookie syncing to identify  users across different websites ( more on that below ). Third-party cookies, also referred to as tracking cookies and third-party trackers, are created by domains  other than the one the user is on. For example, if you visit techcrunch.com and it loads a piece of JavaScript from an AdTech platform (e.g.  ssp1.com), a first-party cookie would be created for techcrunch.com and a third-party cookie would be created  for ssp1.com. 196",670,110,167.5
364,190,"Because ssp1.com is not the domain the user is visiting, it is classed as a third-party cookie. All other cookies created by domains other than techcrunch.com would also be classed as third-party cookies. Third-party cookies have long been the backbone of online advertising, allowing AdTech companies to identify  users as they move around the web, run targeted ad campaigns based on a user’s behavior, and attribute  impressions, visits, clicks and conversions. However, third-party cookies are becoming less effective due to privacy laws like the GDPR, privacy features in  browsers like Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention and Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Prevention, and browser  plugins like AdBlock Plus and Ghostery. How First-Party and Third-Party Cookies Are Created  The image below illustrates how first-party and third-party cookies are created by web browsers.",878,133,219.5
365,191,"With the first method, AdTech platforms can either create cookies via the ad creative when it’s retrieved from  their server or via a 1×1 transparent image. The goal of the 1×1 transparent image is simply to get the browser  to send a request to the AdTech platform’s browser so it can create a cookie when it returns the image. 198",332,62,83.0
366,192,"Comparison of First-Party and Third-Party Cookies  First-Party Cookies  Third-Party Cookies  Setting and Reading the Cookie  ● Can be set and read by the  publisher’s web server or  JavaScript loaded on the  website. ● Can be set on different  websites via JavaScript or  by loading resources from  servers (e.g. 1x1  transparent pixels). Once a  third-party cookie is set to  a user’s device, it is read  when the user visits other  websites that also load the  AdTech platform’s  JavaScript or request a  resource. Availability  ● It can only be read by the  domain that the user is  visiting. ● It's available on any  website that loads the  AdTech platform’s  JavaScript or 1x1  transparent pixel.",701,137,175.25
367,192,Browser Support  ● Supported by all browsers. ● Supported by all browsers. Blocking and Deletion  ● Relatively small deletion  rates. The exception is  Safari’s Intelligent Tracking  Prevention feature that  either deletes first-party  cookies after 24 hours or  seven days. More on that  at the end of this chapter.,316,57,79.0
368,192,"● An increasingly high  deletion and blocking rate. ● Third-party cookies are  blocked by browsers such  as Tor, Safari and Firefox,  and also blocked by  ad-blocking browser  plugins like AdBlock Plus  and Ghostery. Remember flash cookies? Flash cookies act similarly to HTTP cookies but are created via the Adobe Flash plugin, which is used to  power things like videos and mobile apps. About a decade ago, the use of Flash cookies raised a number of privacy concerns due to the lack of control  users had with deletion.",522,96,130.5
369,192,"Flash cookies were stored in a separate folder on devices and could only be  managed via the Adobe Flash settings, meaning that when a user deleted their HTTP cookies, their Flash  cookies remained intact. This led to Adobe and popular web browsers making changes to how Flash cookies were handled. Since  then, Flash cookies are treated the same as HTTP cookies, so if a user deletes their HTTP cookies, Flash  cookies would also be deleted. 199",446,80,111.5
370,193,"For this reason, and because many videos and games are played via HTML5 nowadays, the use and  availability is much lower than in the past, therefore they aren’t used for online advertising anymore. Cookie Syncing  Because cookies created by one domain can’t be read by another, this makes it hard for AdTech platforms to  identify the same user on a given web page. For instance, if a user visits example.com, the cookie that the SSP creates will be different than the one a DSP  creates. To help AdTech platforms identify the same user on different websites, a process known as cookie syncing was  developed. Cookie syncing is the process of mapping one user ID (stored in a cookie) from one technology platform to  another (e.g. from a DMP to a DSP).",753,137,188.25
371,193,"The eventual goal of syncing cookie IDs is to share data about the user  between different platforms, which allows them to better target audiences with online advertisements. The two  platforms would have a formal agreement between one another and would need to set up partner IDs on their  platforms and add cookie-syncing pixels in their codes. The cookie-syncing process is carried out by a number of different platforms in the ecosystem, including  data-management platforms (DMPs), demand-side platforms (DSPs), ad networks, ad exchanges, supply-side  platforms (SSPs) and many more. How Does Cookie Syncing Work? There are two main parts to the cookie-syncing process:  ● Mapping of cookie IDs  ● Sharing of user data contained in the cookies  Mapping Cookie IDs  Each time a user visits a website that contains a cookie-syncing pixel or other advertising-platform tag, the  browser sends a request to a technology platform – for example, a DSP.",951,159,237.75
372,193,"The DSP creates a unique ID for that user, if one doesn’t exist already, and stores that ID in a cookie. The DSP  then redirects (http redirect) the request to the cookie-syncing endpoint URL that has been supplied by a  different advertising platform – for example, a DMP – and passes the user ID as a URL parameter. The DMP’s server reads the user ID created by the DSP from the parameter in the URL and reads the cookie  in its own domain to see if it already has an ID for this particular user. If it doesn’t, the server creates a user ID  of its own, then stores the information about its own ID and the DSP’s ID in a cookie-matching table. The DMP can pass its own identifier back to the DSP so that the sync is bidirectional.",732,144,183.0
373,194,"Now, both the DSP and DMP have each other’s user IDs in each other’s databases. The image below illustrates how the cookie-syncing process looks. Sharing Data Between Two Platforms  Once the cookie IDs have been synced between two AdTech platforms, they can share or request data  contained in the cookies by referencing each other’s user IDs. Typically, this process is done via a server-to-server integration with the data being transferred in large batch  files. Unlike the cookie-matching part that happens in real-time, sharing the data between platforms happens at  a specified time – for example, once a day.",615,102,153.75
374,194,"It’s important to note that cookie syncing is only performed in web browsers (desktop or mobile) across all  types of online advertising, including display, native and video ads. The reason for this is because unlike native mobile apps that use the device’s advertising ID (e.g. IDFA and  AID) as a way to identify users, web browsers don’t emit a consistent user identifier. Cookies from one domain  can’t be accessed by a platform operating under a different domain, so the only way to identify a user across  different websites is by using their cookie ID. Problems With Cookie Syncing  Although cookie syncing allows AdTech companies to identify users across the web, it has a couple of inherent  problems:  201",715,125,178.75
375,195,"● The more cookie syncs a web page needs to perform, the longer it takes the page to load, which can  result in a bad user experience. ● Cookie-match rates vary among platforms, with the average rate sitting between 40-60%. ● Cookie churn, caused by third-party cookies being blocked by default or regularly deleted by users,  means the effectiveness and accuracy of cookie syncing decreases. Cookie Respawning  Cookie respawning is a process whereby a cookie reappears, or respawns, after it has been deleted. It does this by using backed-up data stored in additional files on a user’s device and then respawning the  cookie later when a user accesses the same website again.",676,116,169.0
376,195,The cookie tags the user’s browser with a unique identifier that is not easy to delete. 4. The user leaves the website and deletes their cookies. 5. The user accesses the website again and the new cookie recognizes the identifier in the browser and  respawns the original cookie.,279,49,69.75
377,195,"There are two main ways a cookie can be respawned:  Flash cookies: Companies use the Adobe Flash Player browser plugin to store information about the user on  their computer and to respawn cookies. As mentioned above, flash cookies are rarely used these days. HTML5: HTML5 local storage and cache cookies use entity tags (ETags) to respawn HTML cookies by  recognizing the persistent identification element (PIE) created by JavaScript and Flash. Device Fingerprinting  Device fingerprinting is a technical process that aims to identify and track online users based on the  characteristics of their devices. It works by gathering bits of information to create an identifier, which is then  used to identify individuals across different websites.",744,120,186.0
378,195,"While many different users may own the same device, each one will be configured slightly differently according  to the user’s individual preferences and requirements. Data about these configuration changes can be  aggregated to create a recognizable “device fingerprint.” Information used to create a device fingerprint can include:  ● Browser version  ● Operating system  ● Language  ● Items installed (plugins, fonts, etc.) ● Location and time-zone settings  ● Browser settings  202",484,78,121.0
379,196,"Here’s an example of the HTTP header attributes that are used to create a device fingerprint:  Check out what your device fingerprint looks like at https://amiunique.org or https://panopticlick.eff.org/  The image above illustrates how unique certain attributes are to the user’s device, as represented by the  similarity ratio. For example, the user agent has a similarity ratio of 0.04%, meaning it is very unique to this user. The more unique the attribute is, the more easily it can be used to identify a user. Why Do Companies Use Device Fingerprinting? Device fingerprinting emerged to address a number of challenges that AdTech and analytics companies faced  around the availability and reliability of cookies.",717,115,179.25
380,196,"Over the past decade, online users have regularly deleted and blocked cookies via ad-blocking plugins and  browser settings to protect their online privacy. This has made it harder for AdTech and analytics companies to identify and track users across the web. Although device fingerprinting isn’t as accurate as cookies, it can be used as a backup when cookies are  blocked or deleted, as well as in combination with cookies to help increase the chances of identifying a  particular user. 203",492,83,123.0
381,197,"How Does Device Fingerprinting Work? Creating a device fingerprint requires collecting data and information about a user’s device, which is typically  collected via:  ● The user agent and accept headers  ● JavaScript  ● Flash plugin (if installed)  ● HTML5 canvas elements  What is canvas fingerprinting? Canvas fingerprinting is similar to device fingerprinting, but only uses the HTML5 canvas element to identify  a browser. Companies use a piece of JavaScript to instruct the user’s web browser to draw a picture via the canvas. Each browser will draw a slightly different image, meaning the image is unique (or highly unique) to the  device.",645,109,161.25
382,197,This allows companies to identify and track users across the web. This information is then combined and a unique hash is created and assigned to that device. 204,161,28,40.25
383,198,"Unlike cookies that are stored on a user’s device (client-side), device fingerprints are stored in a database  (server-side) due to the amount of information they collect. HTML5 Local Storage  HTML5 local storage is a newer method for collecting and storing data about users. There are two variants of local storage:  localStorage: Stores data with no expiration date. sessionStorage: Only stores data for the session – i.e. data is deleted when the user closes the browser tab. Compared to cookies, HTML5 local storage provides the following benefits:  ● More storage: HTML5 local storage can store up to 5MB of data, compared to 4KB (4096 bytes) for  cookies.",661,111,165.25
384,198,"● More availability: Most browsers don’t delete HTML5 local-storage data and it isn’t typically blocked by  ad-blocking plugins or browser settings. ● No web-server calls: To create cookies, a request needs to be sent from a web page to a web server  and then back again. HTML5 local storage is created via JavaScript and doesn’t require any calls to  servers. The main downside from an AdTech perspective is that it is domain- and protocol-specific, meaning users can’t  be identified across different domains. ETags  An entity tag (ETag) is an HTTP response header used to improve the efficiency of cache and save bandwidth.",626,107,156.5
385,198,"It does this by assigning an identifier to content (e.g. images) on a web page. When a web page loads, the browser sends off a request to various web servers to retrieve the contents. If a URL has an ETag set for a given resource (e.g. an image), the web server will compare the incoming ETag  with its own ETag. If the two match, it means the image hasn’t changed. The web server will then tell the  browser that the image in the cache is still up to date and can be displayed on the web page.",494,99,123.5
386,198,"AdTech companies can identify users by comparing the ETags sent from a user’s browser with their records. To achieve this, a publisher would need to install an AdTech’s HTML code on their website, typically a 1×1  transparent image (aka pixel). When the page loads, the code will load and send a request containing an ETag to the AdTech vendor’s server. If the ETag coming from the publisher matches the ETag in the AdTech vendor’s server, they would be able to  identify the browser. 205",488,86,122.0
387,199,"Because it’s a standard HTTP request, the AdTech vendor could also collect information about the user, such  as their operating system, browser type, language, location and the URL they are visiting. This information can  be used to create audiences and later for ad targeting. Information created via ETags will be deleted if a user clears or deletes their browser’s cache. Evercookies  An evercookie is a cookie that is saved to various storage locations in a user’s browser and device. It was  created by the privacy and security researcher, Sammy Kamkar.",558,94,139.5
388,199,"Companies can create evercookies via a JavaScript API, which saves data in various locations. If the user  deletes data from one location, such as HTTP cookies, the JavaScript API will recognize that this data has  been removed and simply respawn the cookie from one of the other storage locations.

399,204,"Mobile Apps (In-App)  Identifying users in mobile apps (aka in-app) can consist of the following methods:  Cookies  To display online content inside web apps, some app developers use a piece of technology called webview. Webview can create cookies and store them inside a secure location on the device, which is known as a  sandbox or sandboxed environment. The main issue for AdTech is that these cookies are app-specific, meaning they can’t be shared across  different apps, therefore AdTech companies can’t identify the same user across different apps even though  they are using the same device. Advertising IDs  Mobile devices include an advertising ID:  ● Google’s Android ID (AID)  ● Apple’s ID for Advertising (IDFA)  ● Microsoft’s Advertising ID (aka Advertising Identifier)  These IDs are more persistent than web cookies, and even though users can’t disable or remove these IDs like  they can with cookies, they can easily reset them. 211",949,162,237.25

User Profile Matching  As we’ve just covered, identifying users via one method can be incredibly difficult and inaccurate. The problem is exacerbated when users use more than one device, which is often the case nowadays.",602,93,150.5
404,206,"Currently, there is no method that allows AdTech vendors to identify users as they move from one device to  another. The reason for this is because the traditional ways of identifying and tracking users with cookies in web  browsers wasn’t designed for the multi-device world. There are, however, two ways you can identify and track the same user as they move across different devices  with reasonable accuracy: deterministic matching and probabilistic matching . Deterministic and Probabilistic Matching  Deterministic and probabilistic matching are processes used to identify users across different devices. Companies will often use both deterministic and probabilistic matching together to increase match rates.",714,108,178.5
405,206,What Is Deterministic Matching? Deterministic matching involves creating a profile of users consisting of different pieces of data about them. These profiles are then used to identify users on different devices by looking for a common identifier. Common identifiers can include:  ● Email address  ● First and last name (if uncommon)  ● Address  ● Date of birth  ● Phone numbers  It’s important to note that this information would be hashed when it’s collected to remove personally identifiable  information. 213,511,86,127.75
406,207,"How Does Deterministic Matching Work? The most common way to deterministically match users in online advertising and marketing is by using an  email address as the common identifier, as this is unique to the user and is often available in different data  sets. Companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and LinkedIn are able to deterministically match users with ease  and accuracy because they require users to create accounts and sign in using an email address to access  their applications and sites on different devices. How deterministic matching works. .",559,92,139.75
407,207,"The main advantage of deterministic matching is accuracy. It’s much more accurate than probabilistic  matching; most deterministic matching rates are around 80-90%. The main drawback, however, is that it lacks scale, as most companies don’t collect this type of data and email  addresses aren’t typically used for buying and selling online advertising. To address the issue of scale, publishers are requiring users to create an account or subscribe using their  email address to access certain content. The two main ways they can do this are:  By way of encouragement: Publishers can encourage visitors to provide an email address in exchange for  more access and content.",672,110,168.0
408,208,"By way of force: Publishers can gate their content and restrict access to it unless users subscribe or create  an account. These tactics would work well with large publishers like news sites, as they typically have an engaged  audience that regularly visits their sites compared to small- and medium-sized publishers, as not everyone will  want to create an account just to read a few blog posts. What Is Probabilistic Matching? Unlike deterministic matching that uses a common identifier, such as an email, to match users to devices and  applications, probabilistic matching uses various pieces of data, algorithms, and statistical modeling to make a  match. The type of data used for probabilistic matching includes:  ● IP address  ● Location  ● Interests, behavior, and browsing history  ● Wi-fi networks  The image below illustrates how one user operating all three devices can be probabilistically matched to all of  them based on their IP address, location, interests and Wi-fi network.",992,167,248.0
409,209,"Although probabilistic matching isn’t as accurate as deterministic matching, it often uses deterministic data sets  to train the algorithms and increase accuracy. This process involves exposing the algorithms to a small group of deterministic and probabilistic data sets (a  couple hundred thousand) and training them to make connections (identify the same user). Then, the algorithms are applied to hundreds of thousands or even millions of data sets that don’t contain  deterministic matching. Even though probabilistic matching lacks the accuracy of deterministic matching, the main benefit is that it  offers better scale and reach. However, There are a few downsides to probabilistic matching, including:  ● Lack of transparency of the matching methods and accuracy.",771,118,192.75
410,209,"● Redundant and outdated data. ● Decline in the availability of the data due to data-protection and privacy laws, such as the GDPR,  requiring consent to collect IP addresses, location and other data ( more on this below ). What Are Deterministic and Probabilistic Matching Used For? Because deterministic and probabilistic matching aim to identify users across different devices and apps, their  main use cases are cross-device targeting and cross-device attribution . Cross-device targeting: Identifying users across different devices and showing ads based on their behavior  on different devices – e.g. which websites they visit and what products they purchase.",664,103,166.0
411,209,"For example, a user might view a jacket on a laptop and then see the same jacket or similar product in an ad  on their smartphone. Cross-device attribution: Similar to cross-device targeting, this focuses on attributing impressions and clicks  to conversions and purchases made on different devices. For example, if a user clicked on an ad for running shoes on their smartphone, but purchased them on their  laptop, cross-device attribution would be able to attribute the ad click on the smartphone with the purchase on  the laptop. The Main Challenges With Identifying Users on Web Browser and Mobile  Apps  As we’ve mentioned throughout this chapter, AdTech companies face a number of challenges with identifying  users across web browsers and mobile apps. The table below highlights the main challenges.",806,135,201.5
412,210,"Solutions to the Identity Problem  Due to the direct and severe impact privacy laws and privacy settings are having on identity in online  advertising, and the inefficiencies of cookie syncing, various companies and groups have proposed numerous  ID solutions. The main goals of these ID solutions are to:  ● Identify users on web browsers as they move from website to website. ● Reduce page-load latency caused by cookie syncing. ● Compete with the walled gardens of Google and Facebook that have access to deterministic data and  can offer advertisers better targeting, measurement and attribution. There are many companies that are providing solutions to the ID problem, but here are the main ones:  The Trade Desk offers AdTech and data companies free access to its Unified ID solution (TTID) , which is  hosted under the adsrvr.org domain.",844,143,211.0
413,210,"In July 2020, The Trade Desk revealed that it would be releasing a new  version of it’s Unified ID solution. This newer version of Unified ID, often referred to UID2, is open source and  can be used by all companies, not just those working with The Trade Desk, and will be underpinned by hashed  and encrypted email addresses. The Advertising ID Consortium is powered by the LiveRamp ID and hosted under the AppNexus domain, even  though AppNexus withdrew from the consortium when it was acquired by AT&T in August 2018. 217",524,95,131.0
414,211,"ID5 is a company that allows publishers, data companies and AdTech vendors to outsource their cookie  syncing processes with their partners and use ID5’s cookie-matching table. The Secure Web Addressability Network (SWAN), aka SWAN.community , is another ID solution that is very  similar to UID2, but with a few differences. The main companies behind SWAN.community are Zeta Global ,  51Degrees , Open X , ENGINE Media Exchange (EMX) , PubMatic , Rich Audience and Sirdata . On the 31st of  March, 2021, SWAN began a 60-day consultation period whereby companies can provide feedback on the  modal terms. SWAN is expected to go live in the middle part of 2021.",660,114,165.0
415,211,"How Do These ID Solutions Work? Most of the ID solutions work similarly to each other and act as an ID distribution and retrieval service. They  manage the cookie-syncing and ID-matching processes on behalf of different AdTech platforms, so instead of  DSPs and SSPs having to sync cookies between themselves, they could centralize the process via an ID  solution. Step-by-step explanation:  1. The browser sends an ad request to a DMP with the cookie ID of the user.",467,82,116.75
416,211,"2. The DMP sends the cookie ID to the ID solution and aims to match it with existing IDs. 3. In this case, the cookie ID matches two IDs belonging to DSPs that the DMP has a partnership with. 218",195,40,48.75
417,212,"4. The DMP sends the IDs from the ID solution to its DSP partners. The DSPs use the IDs from the DMP  to identify which audience the user belongs to and then bid accordingly. Although these ID solutions solve some of the challenges related to identity in AdTech, they don’t provide a  complete solution and are still impacted by privacy laws and privacy settings. ID and Device Graphs  Apart from the ID solutions mentioned above, there are many companies that offer ID resolutions services like  ID and device graphs.",518,93,129.5
418,212,"The main goal of these solutions is to piece together IDs from online and offline channels to create a  centralized view of consumers, rather than to use these IDs for online media buying. Below are just some of the companies that provide ID and device graphs:  How Do ID Graphs Work? Here’s an explanation of how ID graphs work:  219",334,63,83.5
419,213,"Step 1. Data collection: A company would send its customer IDs (i.e. first-party IDs) to the ID graph. These  first-party IDs could be taken from websites, mobile apps, and customer and data platforms (e.g. CRMs, CDPs,  and DMPs). Step 2. Match the customer IDs with the IDs in the graph: The company’s first-party IDs would then be  matched with all the other IDs in the graph, which would be done using a combination of deterministic and  probabilistic matching.",464,82,116.0
420,213,"Step 3. Activate the data for cross-device activities: The company can now identify their customers across  different devices and channels and run various cross-device activities, like ad targeting, personalization, and  attribution. 220",237,34,59.25
421,214,"The Challenges Facing These ID Solutions  Apart from the fact that some of the solutions don’t scale in the same way as they once did (i.e. IDs created  from hashed email addresses aren’t as readily available as IDs stored in third-party cookies), all these identity  solutions face the same challenges — they still revolve around identification and rely on some type of ID. The reason this is a problem is because walled gardens like Google and Apple are constantly strengthening  their products to make them more privacy friendly. We’ve seen this with Apple’s ITP and changes to IDFA, and even Google has made changes to how Chrome  handles third-party cookies and is also planning on phasing them out in the near future (possibly by 2022). AdTech companies are moving from one identification method to another, and it won’t be long until Apple  and/or Google make some change to their web browsers or mobile operating systems to prevent these  identification methods. For this reason, many folks in the industry believe that these ID solutions are rather short-term solutions.",1079,184,269.75
422,214,"Many  say that the future of digital advertising and marketing won’t be done on an individual basis, but rather done in  a privacy friendly way where individuals are not identified. It’s too early to say if and when identification will disappear completely, so in the meantime, companies need to  use an identity solution like the ones listed above to ensure they can still run effective advertising and  marketing campaigns. The Future of User Identification in Web Browsers and Mobile Apps  The end of third-party cookies in web browsers means that companies will need to change the way they  identify users to continue powering key AdTech processes, such as behavioral targeting and measurement. Several possible solutions have been proposed, including using email addresses as an ID and utilizing local  storage, but many are limited to one domain and therefore won't be useful for cross-site identification. At the moment, there's no clear alternative to third-party cookies or standards that can be applied by all  companies in the digital advertising ecosystem.",1068,176,267.0
423,214,"But initiatives like the IAB's Rearc Project will help bridge this  gap. Similarly, the future of mobile identifiers also looks bleak with many folks in programmatic advertising  suggesting that it's only a matter of time before Google and Apple turn off their mobile IDs. 221",276,47,69.0
424,215,"11. Data Management Platforms (DMPs) & Data Usage  So far in this book we’ve looked at the role advertising technology platforms play in creating, running, and  optimizing digital ad campaigns. Now we’ll look at one of the most important elements that ties these two areas together: Data. Data is the fuel that powers AdTech platforms and campaigns. Specifically, data in digital advertising can be used for:  ● Identification  ● Targeting  ● Reporting  222",457,79,114.25
425,216,"● Attribution  ● Campaign optimizations  Thanks to the rise of the Internet, advertisers and publishers now have access to enormous amounts of quality  and generalized data sets that could never have been generated in the offline world. These data sets can give  companies deeper insights into consumer behavior, identify trends, and improve campaign performance. In this chapter, we’ll look at how companies collect data, the different types of data, the role of data platforms  like data management platforms (DMP) and customer data platforms (CDPs), and what data is used for. The Different Types Of Data: First-Party, Second-Party, And Third-Party  Data  Not all data is the same, and each piece plays a different role for both advertisers and publishers. First-Party Data  First-party data is considered the most valuable type of data for both advertisers and publishers because it is  collected directly from people who have interacted with the brand, such as customers.",976,160,244.0
426,216,"First-party data is collected by a website or mobile app directly from the visitor/user. First-party data is often collected by:  ● Ecommerce and offline transactions: Data about which products people have purchased and the  value of orders, as well as personal information such as names, postal and billing addresses, email  addresses, and phone numbers. ● Customer relationship management (CRM) systems: Data about people who have created an  account with your business, downloaded a digital product (e.g. ebook), and purchased something from  you. Just like with ecommerce data, this often includes names, addresses, phone numbers, and email  addresses. ● Website and mobile app analytics: Data about which pages the user has browsed, videos they’ve  watched, and other content interactions.",794,125,198.5
427,217,"First-party data can come from online and offline sources (see the section below for more details). Brands and advertisers use this type of data to convert visitors into customers and upsell products and  services to existing customers. Second-Party Data  Second-party data is sometimes referred to as partner data, as it is first-party information collected by one  company and sold or traded to another. Second-party data is collected through data partnerships. A typical partnership involves two non-competing companies with similar audiences.",546,83,136.5
428,217,"For example, a hotel chain could partner with an airline and buy or trade the airline’s first-party data. The hotel  chain could use the airline’s data to run targeted ad campaigns and display ads promoting their hotels to the  airline’s customers. This partnership would benefit the hotel chain, as accommodation is often something people search for when  booking flights. The partnership could be one-way (i.e. the hotel chain buys the airline’s first-party data), or the hotel chain and  airline could set up a data-trade deal where they share information with each other. This would allow the airline to display ads and messages to the hotel chain’s customers as well.",672,113,168.0
429,217,"As the airline collects a lot of value first-party data, they could partner with many other types of companies,  such as with exclusive brands that could target the airline’s high-income customers with luxury products like  watches and jewelry. While first-party data is more valuable, as it contains people who either are existing customers or have  expressed interest in becoming one, second-party data allows brands and advertisers to reach a new,  untapped group of potential customers. 224",494,80,123.5
430,218,"Third-Party Data  In terms of value, third-party data comes in last place. It is neither collected from the advertiser or publisher  directly and isn’t provided via a data partnership agreement. However, third-party data still adds value to marketing and advertising campaigns and provides a couple of  advantages over first- and second-party data, with the ability to reach a much bigger audience being the main  one. Third-party data is collected from a range of different sources. Third-party data is usually supplied by data brokers or is added as a layer by a DMP vendor.",576,97,144.0
431,218,"Many publishers and merchants monetize their data by adding third-party trackers to their websites or tracking  SDK to their apps and passing data about their audiences to data brokers and DMPs. This data can include a user’s browsing history, content interactions, purchases, profile information entered by  the user (e.g. gender or age), GPS geolocation, and much more. Based on these data sets, data brokers can create inferred data points about interests, purchase preferences,  income groups, demographics and more. The data can be further enriched from offline data providers, such as credit card companies, credit scoring  agencies and telcos. From there, data brokers and DMP vendors can create audience segments.",721,113,180.25
432,219,"Audience segments are made up of user profiles, which consist of various pieces of information, such as  interests, location, and demographic information (e.g. gender and age). Check out the Data Normalization and Enrichment in a DMP section located later in this chapter for more  information about user profiles and audience segments. A Comparison Of The Value Of First-, Second-, And Third-Party Data  Below is a comparison that illustrates how the different types of data stack up against each other. First-party data  Second-party data  Third-party data  Relevance and  transparency  ★★★  First-party data is made  up of consumers that  either are existing  customers or who have  engaged with a brand  or publisher, meaning  the audience is usually  already part of the  advertiser’s target  audience. This existing  connection is useful for  activities like up selling,  cross-promoting, and  returning sales.",916,158,229.0
433,219,"★★☆  Second-party data from  one partner quite often  contains audiences that  share similar  characteristics to the  second partner’s target  audience. For example, an audience  created by a luxury hotel  would also match the target  audience of a luxury watch  brand. Given the direct  relationship, it is usually  fully transparent where the  data comes from and how  it was collected. ★☆☆  Because third-party data is  collected and aggregated from  different sources, the direct  connection between an  advertiser and user is lost. This  means the relevance is often  low.",577,109,144.25
434,219,"Also, most data brokers and  DMPs provide little to no  transparency over how they  create data segments. The risks are that some pieces  of data might be outdated or  inaccurate because of  extrapolation and lookalike  modelling. However, given the sheer  number of data sets, it may  provide information that isn’t  available with first-party and  second-party data, such as  purchase preferences and  income group. Accessibility  How easy is it for  an advertiser to  collect? ★★★  As first-party data is  collected directly from  the brand or publisher’s  website or app, it is the  easiest type of data to  collect.",620,119,155.0
435,219,"★☆☆  Second-party data requires  data sharing agreements  and systems integration for  each partner, thus making  it a time-consuming activity. ★★☆  Once an integration with a  DMP or a data broker has been  established, you can buy data  sets on demand without the  need for additional  implementation. Competitiveness  ★★★  ★★☆  ★☆☆  226",339,66,84.75
436,220,"What competitive  advantage could  this type of data  provide? As first-party data is  exclusively available to  the brand or publisher,  it can be used for  high-converting  activities, such as  content and ad  personalization. Second-party data can be  shared exclusively,  meaning it can be used as  a competitive advantage  over other companies  offering the same products  or services. As third-party data is usually  widely accessible, many  companies have access to the  same pieces of data, meaning  third-party data provides less of  a competitive edge. Reach  How many people  could an advertiser  reach by using this  type of data?",642,122,160.5
437,220,"★☆☆  First-party data is  limited to the visitors of  the website (i.e. their  online audience) and  existing customers  (e.g. offline CRM data). ★★☆  Although it offers more  reach than first-party data,  second-part data is still  limited to the partner’s  audience. ★★★  As data brokers and DMPs  aggregate data from multiple  partners, they have data on  almost every user on the  Internet. In practice, the audience is  many times bigger than first-  and second-party data sets  combined. As you can see from the table above, first-party data is by far more valuable than second- and third-party data  in most areas.",621,119,155.25
438,220,"Where Is Data Obtained? Brands, advertisers, marketers, and publishers gather data from a range of online and offline sources. Online Sources  Companies collect huge amounts of online data from a variety of sources, mainly:  ●  Analytics tools  ● Customer-relationship management (CRM) systems  ● Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems  ● Marketing automation platforms  ● Mobile and web apps  ● Campaign analytics  Offline Sources  Offline data can be collected from the following sources:  ●  Point of sale (POS)  ● Offline CRM and ERP systems  ● Transactional data  227",576,101,144.0
439,221,"As all of the above data is collected directly from the user, it is classified as first-party data. The types of data listed above are usually stored in various databases, which can either be the advertiser’s or  marketer’s databases, or the software vendor’s databases. Combining Online and Offline Data Together  Companies that collect both online and offline data would combine them together to get a clearer picture of  their customers and audience. For large companies, such as retailers, integrating their offline and online records is not an easy task, but once  it’s done, it can prove valuable as it provides several business advantages. If, however, a company collects small amounts of offline data (e.g. only email addresses), it is possible to just  import the data into a database or DMP.",801,135,200.25
440,221,"But if a company collects large amounts of offline data, then they will  need to onboard it into a data platform like a DMP or CDP. See the First-Party Data Onboarding section below for more information. The Data Fragmentation Problem  While collecting vast amounts of data from multiple sources allows advertisers to improve campaign  performance, the data is often stored across multiple tools and platforms. These individual databases are often  referred to as data silos . What is a data silo?",497,85,124.25
441,221,"A data silo is a collection of data controlled by one department (e.g. sales) and isolated from other  departments within an organization. The main disadvantage of having data silos is that the data from different departments (or systems) cannot  be integrated together, which restricts the data’s full potential from being realized. 228",337,54,84.25
442,222,"Data silos are individual databases that are not connected with one another. Having data stored in different silos means that advertisers can’t see the full picture of their target audience or  campaigns’ performance, which often leads to poor decision-making, missed opportunities, and ad waste. The solution to this problem is a data management platform (DMP) . 229",367,58,91.75
443,223,"Data Management Platform (DMP)  As we’ve touched on previously, a data management platform (DMP) is a technological platform used to  collect, store, analyze, segment, and activate data. In this section, we’ll look at the main functions of a DMP and uncover some of its potential use cases. Here’s a look at the processes and components of a DMP:  230",351,62,87.75
444,224,"Let’s take a closer look at these components and processes. It’s worth noting that the below processes can also be carried out by other data platforms like customer data  platforms (CDPs), which we cover towards the end of this chapter. Data Collection in a DMP  Collecting data can be done in a few different ways, depending on where the data is stored. Pixels and Tags  Probably the simplest way for a DMP to collect first-party data is by adding a 1×1 transparent pixel (also known  as a tag or tracking pixel) to your website. The pixel itself is just a piece of HTML.",572,107,143.0
445,224,"When the pixel loads on a page, it sends off a request to the DMP to  retrieve the 1×1 transparent image. Once the DMP has returned the 1×1 pixel, it can assign a cookie to the user and store it in their browser. The  information in the cookie can then be passed to the DMP. 231",278,58,69.5
446,225,"Piggybacking  Piggybacking is when we insert a single master pixel on a site’s pages which can either contain or trigger  multiple tracking pixels from various sources and networks that are not placed directly on the site. When the master pixel loads, it subsequently loads the other pixels. The images below illustrate the piggybacking process:  Piggybacking advantages  Piggybacking restrictions  One pixel can consolidate all third-party pixels. Image pixels can only piggyback off one image pixel. A single pixel keeps everything clean and organized.",554,87,138.5

Just like with pixels, tags are added to a website and when loaded,  send a request to a DMP. The DMP responds to the request and places a cookie in the user’s browser and  collects data.",374,71,93.5
449,226,"Sometimes, publishers will use a tag management system (TMS) to control and manage the various  JavaScript snippets and pixels they have on their website. These tags and pixels are placed in a container  which is inserted into a website’s pages, usually directly under the opening body element <body>. The main benefit of a tag manager is that publishers can easily add, remove, and modify their HTML tags,  JavaScript snippets, and pixels from a single user interface, rather than having to ask their web developers to  make manual changes in the website’s HTML. Application Program Interface (API)  APIs are used to exchange data between web servers and a DMP. This type of data exchange is ideal for  companies that have a number of data silos as it allows them to efficiently collect data from different  databases.",819,142,204.75
450,226,"This form of data collection is also referred to as a server-to-server integration. First-Party Data Onboarding  First-party data onboarding involves taking a company’s offline customer data and integrating it with their  online customer data. So, for example, a company could have the following customer data in their offline database:  ● Names  ● Residential addresses  ● Phone numbers  ● Email addresses  ● Dates of birth  ● And all other data they have about customers in their offline customer relationship management (CRM)  and transactional systems. They could then onboard it with the data they have in their online databases, such as:  ● Data from their web-analytics tools and ad servers. ● User account information (e.g. account information from the company’s online payment system).",794,131,198.5
451,226,"● Any other online information the company has collected about the customer, including the same  information they’ve collected offline — e.g. name, email, and residential address. 233",183,28,45.75
452,227,"Depending on the amount of offline data a company has, they might just be able to import the data as a CSV  file. But if they have a large amount of data, which is often the case, then they would likely need to use a data  onboarding platform like LiveRamp. Here’s a list of some of the most common data-onboarding platforms on the market:  The general process involves a company uploading offline data with an onboarding platform, anonymizing it to  remove any personally identifiable information (PII), e.g. email addresses, names, physical addresses, etc., and matching the offline data with the company’s online data. How can data be anonymized?",649,112,162.25
453,227,"Below are the most common ways to anonymize data and remove PII:  Hashing – irreversibly converting data into a non-human readable value. Encryption – making the data accessible only to those with the decryption key. Generalization – replacing a specific category with a more general one, for example, changing a user’s age  from 42 to an age range of 40-49, Starbucks Coffee Shop at Wrocław Market Place to a coffee shop . Suppression – replacing attributes, or parts of them. For example, changing a zip code from 44340 to 44***,  location from 51.1088316,17.032966 to 51.1******,17.0******  Adding noise – adding random values to numeric attributes in a way that their average remains unchanged.",698,116,174.5
454,227,"Swapping the data – exchanging certain fields of one record with the same fields of another similar record,  for example, swapping the ZIP codes of two records. The definition of “anonymized data” varies among companies and countries. 234",238,39,59.5
455,228,"In the USA, it generally means removing personally identifiable information like names, postal addresses,  and email addresses. However, under certain privacy laws, like the EU’s GDPR, the term anonymized data means any data that  can’t be used to identify a person. So, even if a company just collects cookie IDs, device IDs, and IP  addresses, this data is still classed as personal data under the GDPR because AdTech and MarTech  platforms can still identify users using those pieces of data (e.g. identify returning visitors).

458,229,"The first-party data onboarding process. Data Onboarding With Google AdWords and Facebook Ads  Due to the vast amounts of data that is being onboarded via companies like LiveRamp, the process can be  quite complex and take a number of days to complete. Other companies, like Google and Facebook allow advertisers to upload simpler offline and online data sets  (typically just an email address) to their platforms and use it for targeting and retargeting. Although this method  doesn’t offer the same scale as data onboarding via the companies above, it’s often a suitable option for small-  and medium-sized companies. 236",623,104,155.75
459,230,"Google Ads  Google’s Customer Match service allows companies to upload their audience data to Google Ads and target  those customers, as well as related audiences, across Google’s properties, including the Search Network and  Google Shopping, YouTube, Gmail, and the Display Network. The data that can be uploaded to Customer Match includes:  ● Email  ● First name  ● Last name  ● Country  ● Zip code  ● Phone number  Facebook Ads  Facebook’s Custom Audiences works in a similar way to Google’s Customer Match. This service allows companies to not only upload customer email lists to Facebook Ads for targeting on the  Facebook platform, but to also place a tracking pixel on their website and/or app. From there, the pixel will  track that user and then display a customized ad or offer to that user on Facebook.

The data normalization and enrichment stage provide two main benefits:  1.",388,61,97.0
461,231,"During the normalization and enrichment stage, each user will be assigned a unique ID and given different  attributes, which will play a key role in the segmentation stage. These attributes can include:  ● Age  ● Gender  ● Location  ● Browser history  ● Interests  ● Purchase history  Profile Building and Merging  A profile is a set of data collected from events tracked by a DMP. It represents a user and may contain the  following pieces of information:  ● profile id  ● cookie id (list)  ● hashed email (list)  ● sid / uuid (list)  ● country (last seen)  ● name ( nullable )  ● device_type (last seen)  ● device_vendor (last seen)  ● device_os (last seen)  ● browser_vendor (last seen)  ● gender (nullable)  ● company (nullable)  ● company size (nullable)  ● matching ids (list)  In some cases, a profile will be created containing only a few pieces of data (e.g. cookie id, device_type, and  device_os) and will be extended when more data becomes available — i.e. profile building . When a DMP receives new events containing a known piece of data (i.e. one that is in the DMP), then it is  added to the relevant profile. On the other hand, if an input event contains a new piece of data (i.e. one that isn’t in the DMP), then a new  profile is created.",1257,248,314.25

464,233,"All three events come from the same user, but this isn’t known until the third event arrives in the DMP, meaning  all three events would be treated as separate profiles. For this example, all three profiles would be merged together into one profile. Most DMPs would use a master ID — a single ID associated with one profile — to ensure accurate profile  merging. Most often this would be a persistent ID, such as an email address. When new events containing the master ID enter the DMP, all other data associated with the event will be  added to that profile.",559,103,139.75
465,233,How to Merge Profiles Together  There are a few ways a DMP can merge profiles together. Below we’ll list some of the main ways. Overwrite existing IDs and attributes: This is one of the simplest ways to merge profiles as it simply  replaces existing IDs with new ones as they enter the DMP. 240,294,56,73.5
466,234,"Alphabetical sorting: This method sorts the values alphabetically and then uses the first value. For example,  if there were 2 profiles with the names “Robert” and “Bob”, then “Bob” would be used as the name value  because the letter “B” comes before “R”. Timestamp sorting: With this method, the value that has the first or last recorded timestamp would be used. In most cases, timestamp sorting will be the most desired method to use. Wait-and-see sorting: A more complex approach would be to keep all values for reference until a different  sorting method (e.g. timestamp) becomes available.",594,100,148.5
467,234,"Then you’d be able to see whether the assumption was  correct and decide on the final values after the merging operation has finished. Data Storage  Although the concept of storing data in a DMP seems rather simple, the actual technical implementation can  be challenging due to the large amount of data being stored, as well as the need to move it to other areas and  prevent data loss. Data Taxonomies  Taxonomy in a DMP refers to the naming convention used for various pieces of data. For example, instead of having two taxonomies like “user” and “visitor”, you could create or define one  taxonomy (e.g. “user”) that represents both terms. Below is an example of how an ecommerce store could structure its taxonomies:  241",726,130,181.5
468,236,"Audience Segmentation and Creation  Audience segmentation involves placing users into groups based on common characteristics, such as age,  location, behavior, interests, and many others. These segments form the basis for data activation, whereby these segments are used for a number of different  purposes, such as for ad targeting and analytics. See the Use Cases Of Data Activation With A Data Management Platform (DMP) section below for more  details. How A DMP Creates Audience Segments  To create audience segments, a DMP uses a series of conditions to filter the data and produce specific groups  of users. The conditions may include general information such as:  ● Country, region, or city  ● Device type  ● Operating system  ● Referral URL  And may also include more specific data about users’ behavior like:  ● Events (button clicks, page-views, etc.)",861,146,215.25
469,236,"● Conversions (downloads, purchases, etc.) ● Ads viewed  It could also contain demographic data, such as:  ● Relationship status: In a relationship  ● Interests: Gardening  ● Age group: 35-39  ● Gender: Male  ● Home Value: Between $200k – $400k  ● Annual income: Between $60k – $90k  Advertisers can then combine multiple segments to directly target the audiences they want to reach with their  online advertising campaigns. 243",428,76,107.0
470,237,"Here’s an example of what that might look like:  An example of how a DMP creates audience segments. Apart from selecting which users to include in an audience segment, you can also add filters to exclude users  from the segment and set the recency and frequency of certain actions. For example, you could add users who have viewed your website at least 5 times (frequency) in the past 30  days (recency). These two additional factors will go a long way towards defining your audience segments and their usefulness  and can significantly impact the relevance and scope of the segments. Relevance : Increasing the time frame for data points to be included.",654,115,163.5
471,237,"For instance, setting a time frame of  “greater than 30 days” can add users who may be less likely to convert. However, raising the frequency to “at  least 3 times” for certain event information can mean adding a user who is highly engaged and likely to  convert. Scope : Similarly, extending the time frame and reducing the frequency will broaden the scope of the audience,  which would be useful for brand awareness but not for increasing conversions. Once you’ve created audience segments, you can now activate your data . 244",529,94,132.25
472,238,"Use Cases Of Data Activation With A Data Management Platform (DMP)  Data activation in a DMP is using audience segments for a range of different activities. It’s often considered the  most important function of a DMP. Below are the most common ways advertisers and publishers can activate their data and audience segments  in their DMP. Data Activation for Advertisers  Media Buying And Optimization  For advertisers and marketers, activating their data for digital media buying is one of the main use cases. The main way to activate data for media buying is via cookie syncing .",579,100,144.75
473,238,"We covered cookie syncing in a previous chapter: 10. User Identification  First, the advertiser would start by integrating their DSP with a DMP. From there, the advertiser can create  audiences and sync their cookies with the DMP’s cookies so they can identify their audience across multiple  publishers. When an advertiser (via a DSP) identifies a user who belongs to one of their audiences, they can show them  an ad that is more personalized and relevant. Because this form of targeting is more dynamic than traditional  targeting (e.g. showing iphone users the same ad), it often produces more clicks and conversions.",621,105,155.25
474,239,"It’s important to note here that the DMP could either have its pixel on the publisher’s website, or it could  receive it from the SSP via piggybacking, or both. Brands and advertisers can also use a DMP to improve retargeting and dynamic creative optimization. Another key part of activating data in a DMP for media buying is improving campaign performance and  reducing ad waste. DMPs can provide advertisers with detailed reports, allowing them to see the best and worst performing  audiences, and make real-time optimizations to increase reach, performance, and optimize media spend. Look-alike Modeling  Advertisers can use a DMP to perform lookalike modeling — a process that finds people that have similar  characteristics to an advertiser’s target audience.",764,124,191.0
475,239,"For example, an ecommerce store selling motorsport gear wanting to increase its audience could perform  lookalike modeling to find new people who were interested in motorsports but hadn’t visited their store. They  could define a set of criteria that matched their existing audience, such as location and interests, and then use  a DMP to create those new audiences. 246",370,62,92.5
476,240,The ecommerce store could also place a pixel from a DMP on their purchase confirmation page to collect data  about customer behavior across different websites. The DMP could analyze this data and look for similarities in  behavior among the store’s existing customers. These similarities can then be used as the basis for creating  new audiences. How Does Look-alike Modeling Work? Lookalike modeling analyzes data and uses algorithms to identify common characteristics and similarities in  behavior.,500,79,125.0
477,240,"Because the main goal of lookalike modeling is to find new audiences, it works best when it’s able to analyze  data outside of an advertiser’s own database. For this reason, most lookalike modeling is done by DMPs that  have collected large amounts of data from multiple sources. To create a look-alike model, advertisers need to define the attributes and behaviors of their most valuable  customers. The stricter the look-alike model is (i.e. the more attributes), the better chance advertisers have of finding more  people who match their target audience. This will improve the advertiser’s chances of receiving more  conversions.",632,104,158.0
478,240,"However, advertisers could be less strict with the look-alike model by defining fewer attributes and behaviors if  their goal is to focus on reach and awareness rather than higher conversion rates. Below is an example of a look-alike model that has tightly defined (more) attributes and behaviors, and one  that has loosely defined (less) attributes and behaviors. 247",368,60,92.0
479,241,"What Can Look-alike Modeling Be Used For? The main use case of look-alike modeling is prospecting, which involves finding new potential customers  and/or visitors. However, it can also extend the reach of online advertising campaigns. Let’s say you target audiences based on a set of attributes, such as age, gender and location. By applying look-alike modeling to your campaigns, you can find similar customers who perhaps aren’t  included in your current audiences because you don’t have enough data (e.g. we lack the attributes needed to  make a match) or they don’t fit your current audiences (i.e. they consist of other attributes) but are still similar  to your best customers.",683,113,170.75
480,241,"Audience intelligence  Advertisers can enrich visitor and customer data by matching and comparing their current audiences against  third-party data sets and adding information about both customers and prospects, including their  demographics, interests, income or purchase preferences, to their database. 248",308,43,77.0
481,242,"This allows them to learn more about how people behave, fine tune their target audience, and identify what  makes them convert. Brands and advertisers can use audience intelligence to optimize and personalize certain areas of their site  and campaigns to improve engagement and increase conversions. For example, a travel website that promotes thousands of different hotels and resorts may identify a group of  visitors who are less price sensitive, but require more flexibility and display more expensive offers with a free  cancellation option to them. Data Activation For Publishers  So far, we’ve explained the ways in which advertisers can use a DMP for data activation, so now it’s time to  have a look at how publishers can utilize a DMP. Similar to advertisers, the first step in monetizing their revenue is to create audience segments.",844,141,211.0
482,242,"From there,  they can be used for a number of different use cases. Here are the main ways publishers can activate their data. Increase the Value of Their Inventory  Due to the large volume of user data that many medium- and large-size publishers collect, they can increase  the value of their inventory by creating audiences and then offering them to advertisers. The reason this benefits publishers is because advertisers will pay a higher price (e.g. CPM or CPC rate) if  they know that their ad will be seen by the right target group and highly engaged users. How are publishers able to pass these audience segments to advertisers?",634,112,158.5
483,242,"There are a few ways publishers can make their audience segments available to advertisers and increase their  ad revenue:  1. Cookie syncing: A publisher’s SSP could sync cookies with a DMP or DSP to allow advertisers to bid  on impressions that will be shown to a user in their target audience. 2. Deal IDs in PMP deals: Private marketplace deals allow publishers to offer their most prized inventory  to a select group of advertisers. By broadcasting their audience segments in PMP deals, publishers can  earn even more money on their premium inventory.",555,97,138.75
484,242,"3. Segment ID in RTB auctions: A publisher’s SSP or DMP can pass segment IDs to DSPs during  real-time bidding (RTB) auctions to help advertisers find their target audience. Improve Engagement and Conversions With Content Personalization  Content personalization involves displaying content and recommendations that match users’ preferences  based on their demographic information, interests, and the content they’ve consumed in the past. The example below illustrates how using a DMP for content personalization works:  249",524,78,131.0
485,244,"Content personalization on a site that does use a DMP. Audience Extension For Publishers  Publishers can use a DMP to create audience segments, which can be used for audience extension. Audience extension involves a publisher creating audiences from their first-party data, which includes  contextual and behavioral data like age, location, interests, web history, purchase history, click-based  interactions, etc. Publishers can then push these audiences to AdTech platforms, allowing advertisers to target these audiences  across the Internet — not just target them on the publisher’s websites. 251",600,90,150.0
486,245,Here’s an overview of how audience extension works:  1. The publisher’s DMP collects its first-party data and creates audience segments. 2. The DMP passes on the publisher’s audience segments to advertisers via DSPs. This is done via  cookie syncing.,250,41,62.5
487,245,"3. If an advertiser’s DSP identifies a publisher’s audience during an RTB auction originating from a  different website, then it bids on that impression. 4. If the DSP wins, the ad is displayed to the publisher’s audience but on a different site. Audience extension is a win-win for publishers and advertisers — it allows publishers to create a new revenue  stream and advertisers to find their target audiences across more websites.",433,73,108.25
488,245,"Data Partnership  The publisher can set up a direct and exclusive partnership with another website, for example, a site that wants  to run ad campaigns targeted at people living in the New York area that listen to the music online. The data  used by the second website then becomes second-party data. 252",304,55,76.0
489,246,"Data partnerships allow publishers to monetize their data. Selling Their Data  The publisher could also just sell the segments or anonymized user profiles to data companies (e.g. data  brokers and DMPs). The data broker could either use the segments created by the publisher or group the anonymized user profiles  into demographic segments based on different characteristics, such as location, age, interests, etc. The data broker would then resell the data to advertisers who want to direct their campaigns to a specific  demographic group. The data in these user segments would now be classified as third-party data.",618,100,154.5
490,247,"Publishers can monetize their data via a data broker. Compared to the partnership option, this monetization process is much less transparent. The publisher also  loses its independence, as it is the data broker who decides which segments of data are shared and what  kinds of segments are created from the publisher’s visitors. Data Brokers and Integrations With Programmatic Media-Buying Platforms  While all companies that operate within the online advertising industry collect data, there are some companies  that make a business only out of collecting and selling online consumer data. These companies are known as  data brokers , or information brokers .",659,106,164.75
491,247,"What Is A Data Broker? A data broker is a company that aggregates user profiles from publishers and brands, combines them together,  segments them, and then sells the segments to other companies to use in their online advertising campaigns. There are several types of data brokers that operate in certain industries:  ● Marketing and advertising: Improve ad targeting and campaign measurement. ● Identity verification and fraud detection : Help organizations like banks verify the identity of  individuals. ● People search : Collect publicly available information about people from social media websites.",604,94,151.0
492,248,"DMPs and data brokers collect data from various sources, create audiences, and then sell them to AdTech  companies. Some examples of data brokers in online advertising include:  255",181,30,45.25
493,249,"In the digital advertising and marketing industries, many DMPs act as data brokers and vice versa. The data  collection process is similar to that of DMPs (listed above). Data Pricing Models  Once DMPs and data brokers have collected the data, they usually sell it on to advertisers and AdTech  vendors via two pricing models: a fixed CPM or a percentage of the media cost. Fixed CPM Price  The most common way for DMPs and data brokers to sell data is on a cost per mille (cost per thousand) basis. This means they are paid a fixed amount, such as $1.25 for each 1,000 unique cookies created by their site(s).",610,113,152.5
494,249,"The main advantage of this model is that it provides a guaranteed price for both the data provider and  advertiser/media buyer. However, it doesn’t take into account important variables, such as context or the real value of the ad  placement, meaning it places a fixed price on the audience which could actually be worth more than the CPM  price suggests. There are also issues surrounding the ROI of audience data sold on a fixed CPM price. Often, the CPM price of audience data is actually more than the CPM price of the impression itself. This means  that an advertiser could buy an impression on a CPM of $1.10 but the CPM of the audience data could be  $1.25, which adds significant cost and makes generating a reasonable ROI much harder to achieve.",754,137,188.5
495,249,"Percentage of the Media Cost  Many data brokers and advertisers/media buyers are moving towards a percentage of media cost pricing  model due to the very issues the fixed CPM pricing model presents. As the name suggests, data providers charge advertisers and media buyers a percentage of the media cost for  their audience data. So if the impression was sold at a CPM of $.50 and the data provider charged 20% of the media cost, then the  advertiser or media buyer would pay $.10 for the audience data. While it may appear that the data brokers is losing money via the % of media cost, they are actually making  third-party data more valuable and useful for advertisers and media buyers as they benefit from improved  targeting, optimized ROIs, and better campaign performance — all of which lead to high adoption rates of  third-party data, which spells good news for data brokers. The image below illustrates the cost differences associated with the fixed CPM pricing model and the % of  media cost pricing model:  256",1020,182,255.0
496,250,"The % of the media cost pricing model is a fairer and more accurate way of selling third-party data to  advertisers and media buyers. Some common problems with using third-party data in programmatic media buying:  Problem 1: The main issue with this method of selling through technology platforms is that it’s often hard to  know whether a DSP used a certain audience from a DMP. In the RTB auction model, data is usually provided in every bid request sent to the DSP. The bidder on DSP  side sends bids on behalf of the advertiser, but there is no way to tell if the bidder used the data during the  exchange. Problem 2: The other problem with this model is that the price of the data is usually static.",704,133,176.0
497,250,"The only difference is that some segments are considered premium or of higher value than others, and the  CPM price is then higher. There is no way to dynamically set the price for the data based on the demand  and/or quality, and therefore, all the parties in the ecosystem (e.g. publishers, data suppliers, data providers,  advertisers, etc.)may be losing out financially. The Future of DMPs  Because every digital advertising process is powered by data, DMPs have been a key component of a brand's,  agency’s, and publisher’s tech stack. But the business model and future of many DMPs is in jeopardy because of the rise of privacy in AdTech.",644,113,161.0
498,251,"Privacy laws like the GDPR, ad blockers, and privacy settings in web browsers are making it much harder to  collect third-party data from websites. Google Chrome’s announcement that they’ll be shutting off support for third-party cookies by 2022 (rough  timeline), means that almost 100% of web browser traffic won’t support third-party cookies. To survive the next decade, most DMPs will need to look for ways to help publishers and advertisers identify  their audiences without the use of third-party cookies, for example, by using identity resolution services. Advertisers and publishers will also need to think about how they unlock the value of their first-party data. In fact, this is already happening with the rise of customer data platforms (CDPs) .",758,122,189.5
499,251,"What Is a Customer Data Platform (CDP)? A customer data platform is a piece of software that collects data from different sources and creates a single  customer view of a customer, aka single customer view (SCV). Although DMPs and CDPs are fairly similar in the way they collect, normalize, enrich, and activate data, there  are a couple of main differences in the type of data they collect and how they use it. As we mentioned above, DMPs typically collect third-party data and use it for advertising purposes. CDPs  mainly collect first-party data and use it for multiple purposes, such as advertising, marketing, and customer  support.",638,109,159.5
500,252,"The image above illustrates how CDPs work and common advertising and marketing use cases. The rise of privacy laws and changes to web cookies has forced advertisers and publishers to put more focus  on utilizing their first-party data. Publishers, for example, can collect first-party data, create user profiles and audiences in a CDP, and offer  those audiences to advertisers for ad targeting. Now that we’ve had a detailed look at the role data plays in the online advertising ecosystem, it’s time to turn  our attention to an area that heavily relies on data - attribution . 259",582,100,145.5

Attribution  Identifying users across online channels, online and offline channels, and across numerous devices is a critical  part of digital advertising as it allows advertisers to gain a better understanding of how their audience interacts  with their brand and improve the customer journey.

503,254,"What is a customer journey? A customer (aka user) journey is the path a person takes from the time they first become aware of a brand to  the time they complete a goal defined by an advertiser or marketer (e.g. a purchase or download). Although everyone will have a different customer journey, it’s useful for advertisers and marketers to  understand how the different stages of a customer journey and the interactions a person has influence their  decision to complete a goal. Each interaction a person has with a brand during their customer journey is known as a touchpoint. What is a touchpoint?",598,105,149.5
504,254,"A touchpoint is an interaction a user has with your brand on different channels. But a user doesn’t have to actually interact with the touchpoint for it to count. For example, if a user sees a  display ad from a brand but doesn’t click on it, then it’s still classed as a touchpoint. Examples of touchpoints include:  ● Website visits  ● Product views  ● Reviews  ● Blog posts  ● Ebooks and whitepapers  ● Digital ads  ● Social media content  ● Videos  ● Emails  ● Store visits  In many cases, these touchpoints will influence a person’s perception about your brand. Advertisers and marketers will tailor the messaging across different touchpoints depending on where the  person is in the customer journey (e.g. awareness, consideration, and purchase).",752,137,188.0

506,255,"We’ll now look at the different types of attribution. Online to Online Attribution Models  Online to online attribution identifies which touchpoints a user had before they completed a goal across  different online channels. As the goal of most online ad campaigns is to drive users to a website, advertisers and marketers view  attribution reports provided by web analytics tools, MarTech platforms like marketing automation platforms and  attribution software, and AdTech platforms like ad servers. There are two main types of online to online attribution — inter-channel and intra-channel . Inter-channel attribution looks at touchpoints across different channels.",666,101,166.5
507,255,"Intra-channel attribution looks at touchpoints in the same channel. How Does Online Attribution work? When it comes to detecting which online channels and interactions a user had in their customer journey, there  are a few ways you can do this. The simplest way is to use the Referrer field in the HTTP protocol when a user is directed from an online  channel to your website. 262",380,68,95.0
508,256,"The Referrer field is passed with every request from the browser to the web server. Here’s an example of a  standard HTTP GET request:  GET / HTTP/1.1  Host: clearcode.cc  DNT: 1  Accept-Language: en-us  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  Referrer: http://publisher1.com/article-about-adtech.html  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/603.3.8  (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.1.2 Safari/603.3.8  …  In this example, a user was reading an article on publisher1.com and then clicked on a link (or ad) and was  directed to https://clearcode.cc . Web analytics tools, and AdTech and MarTech platforms will display the following referrers:  Direct  When a visit is marked as direct it means that the referrer information isn’t known. There are many reasons why a referrer can be marked as direct:  ● The user entered the URL in their brower’s web address bar or accessed it from their bookmarks. ● The user entered the website from a subdomain, e.g. they first accessed publisher1.com and then  clicked on a link that took them to blog.publisher1.com.",1077,178,269.25
509,256,"● The user clicked on a link or ad in a native mobile app that didn’t contain UTM parameters in the URL  (e.g. publisher1.com/?utm_campaign=native-app). ● There were some technical issues that resulted in referrer loss, such as clicking on a link from a secure  website (https://) to an unsecure website (http://).

Online Attribution Models  Now that we know how the different online channels are detected, we’ll now look at the different online  attribution models. 1. The Last Click Attribution Model  The last click (aka last interaction or last touchpoint ) attribution model is the oldest model out of them all  and despite the number of new attribution models, it is still the default model in many web analytics, MarTech,  and AdTech platforms. The last click attribution model assigns 100% of a conversion to the last known referral, click, or traffic source.",786,127,196.5

514,258,"Although this model is one of the simplest, it ignores all the other touchpoints in a customer journey, which can  lead to poor decision making when choosing which channels to optimize. 2. The Last Non-Direct Attribution Model  The last non-direct attribution model is very similar to the last click attribution model but it removes direct  visits from the equation. With this model, 100% of a conversion is attributed to the last known referral that wasn’ t a direct visit. Here’s an example of how this process looks:  1.",523,92,130.75
515,258,A user clicks on a link on Facebook and is directed to your website. 2. They browse your website but then leave. 3. They later type your website into their address bar and download one of your ebooks.,200,38,50.0

517,259,"This model is better than the last click model, but still doesn’t take into account the other touchpoints a person  has in their customer journey and can also lead to bad decisions. 3. The First Click Attribution Model  The first click (aka first interaction or first touch ) attribution model is similar to the previous two, except it  assigns 100% of a conversion to the first click or referrer in the customer journey. This model suffers from the same drawbacks as last click and last non-direct attribution models. 266",522,92,130.5
518,260,"4. The Linear Attribution Model  The linear attribution model evenly attributes conversions to all touchpoints in a customer journey. Even though this model values each conversion equally, which rarely is the case, it is useful for getting an  overview of the customer journey. 5. The Time Decay Attribution Model  The time decay attribution model is a modification of the linear model.",386,64,96.5
519,260,"With this attribution model, the touchpoint that is closest in time to the conversion gets the most credit. The remaining touchpoints are given credit based on how far away they are from the conversion. Put simply,  the further away a touchpoint is from a conversion, the more its credit “decays”. It not only provides the full picture of the customer journey but also assigns a certain weight to each touchpoint  based on the time difference between each touchpoint. 267",471,81,117.75
520,261,"The above image illustrates how the different touchpoint could be attributed for the conversion. This model assumes that the most recent touchpoints were the ones that influenced the user to convert, which  may or may not be the case. 6. The Position Based Attribution Model  The position based attribution model grabs all the touchpoints in the customer journey and assigns them  credit based on their position in the conversion path. This model gives more weight to the first and last interaction in the customer journey.",523,88,130.75
521,262,"This model is often a good choice for advertisers as it provides an overview of the customer journey and  assigns credit to the two most important interactions — the first and last interactions. 7. The Custom Attribution Model  Some AdTech and MarTech platforms allow you to create custom attribution models whereby advertisers set  their own rules for attributing touchpoints in a customer journey. This option is often a good choice for advertisers as they can take into consideration the specifics of their  campaigns, their customers, and customer journey. The above online attribution models are specific to one device (e.g. a laptop and smartphone) and web  browser (e.g. Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome).",714,117,178.5
522,262,"If we want to attribute conversions from different devices  and web browsers, then we’ll have to use cross-device attribution. Cross-Device Attribution  Cross-device attribution aims to record interactions a user has with a brand across multiple touchpoints and  devices, and ultimately attribute conversions accordingly. Where online attribution models aim to attribute  conversions across different channels, multi-touch attribution aims to attribute conversions across different web  browsers and devices, as well as channels. Here’s an example of how cross-device attribution would look:  How Does Cross-Device Attribution Work? To attribute online conversions between different channels, AdTech and MarTech companies use cookies —  typically third-party cookies.",767,108,191.75
523,263,"However, because cookies are tied to one device and one web browser, they can’t be exported to another,  meaning they are useless for cross-device attribution. To attribute conversions across different web browsers and devices, measurement companies use  deterministic matching, probabilistic matching, or a combination of both. We explained what these two methods are and how they work in a previous chapter (10. User Identification),  but here’s a recap:  Deterministic matching uses common identifiers, such as email addresses and phone numbers, to identify  and match users across different devices. Probabilistic matching uses less-common pieces of data, such as IP addresses and location data, to identify  and match users across devices.",744,115,186.0
524,263,"Because the data isn’t as accurate or unique as deterministic data,  probabilistic matching also uses algorithms and statistical modeling to make a match. To use these methods for cross-device attribution, AdTech and MarTech companies would create user profiles  that collect and contain these pieces of data. Below are two examples of how deterministic matching and probabilistic matching can be used for  cross-device attribution:  Deterministic matching for cross-device attribution  270",490,74,122.5
525,264,"Probabilistic matching for cross-device attribution:  As we can see in the examples above, the actual attribution process is similar for both deterministic and  probabilistic matching. The main difference is the data that is used to identify the user and attribute the  conversion. For walled gardens like Google and Facebook, attributing conversions with deterministic matching is much  easier than for independent AdTech companies because of the types of data they collect — e.g. email  addresses and names — and because many users will use their Facebook or Google account across different  devices. If brands, agencies, and independent AdTech companies (e.g. DSPs) want to conduct cross-device attribution,  then they’ll need to use a DMP like LiveRamp or a cross-device measure platform like Tapad . These companies will collect user data from different online and offline sources, create user profiles, and  produce a graph — sometimes referred to as an identity, ID, or device graph.",990,160,247.5
526,265,"An illustration of how ID graphs work. Learn more about the various identity solutions and how they work in chapter 10. User Identification . Offline-Online Attribution  Even though advertising and marketing is moving online, there is still a need to combine the offline data with  online data and attribute and track users across offline and online sources. For example, it’s important for advertisers to know whether a billboard ad resulted in a website visit or online  conversion.",484,80,121.0
527,265,Examples of offline channels include:  ● Direct mail  ● Traditional outdoor advertising — i.e. out-of-home (OOH) and digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising. ● Telemarketing  272,177,27,44.25
528,266,"● TV  ● Radio  Below are the most common ways for advertisers to attribute offline ad exposure with online conversions. Vanity URLs  Vanity URLs are domain names that are often created for a specific advertising campaign. They’re designed to  match the company’s brand, be easy to remember, and shorter than the actual URL of the landing page. Companies use vanity URLs to promote a new product or service and use them in OOH, TV, and radio ads. For example, instead of using a URL like  company1.com/new-product?utm_source=ooh&utm_medium=billboard-airport&utm_campaign=new-product ,  an advertiser could use newproduct.com .",625,99,156.25
529,266,"The vanity URL could take the user to a dedicated landing page, (e.g. newproduct.com) or redirect them to a  different landing page (e.g. company1.com/new-product). With either option, the vanity URL will redirect the  user to a destination page and add campaign tracking parameters for traffic attribution. There are different types of vanity URL:  1. Standalone vanity URLs, e.g. newproduct.com  2. Subpage vanity URLs, e.g. company1.com/newproduct  3.",454,71,113.5
530,266,"Shortened vanity URLs, e.g. sv.ly/newproduct  Vanity URLs are useful for measuring the reach and impact of offline ad campaigns and attributing them to  online website visits and conversions, but they are not 100% accurate because some users who saw the ad  may later perform a Google search for the product or service instead of typing in the vanity URL. This means  any conversion that occurs as a result of this will be attributed to Google Search and not the offline ad. However, it’s still a valuable method for gauging the effectiveness of an offline ad. Time-limited attribution windows  Another way to measure offline ad exposure to online web traffic and conversions is via the time-limited  attribution window. This model analyzes a period of time (e.g. 30 minutes) after the air time of a TV or radio advertisement and  looks for increases in web traffic and conversions.",882,153,220.5
531,266,"When applying this model, advertisers need to consider the following:  ● How long should the window be open?E.g. should we look at web traffic and conversions 30 minutes  after our radio ad aired or longer? ● How can we separate the traffic and conversions that were exposed to the campaign from the ones that  weren’t? ● How do we determine whether other campaigns influenced the increase in traffic and conversions  during the attribution window? 273",452,79,113.0
532,267,"Most AdTech and MarTech companies offer an attribution window model as part of their measurement offering,  but it’s often limited to one channel (e.g. display). If advertisers want to measure offline ad exposure to online  web traffic and conversions, then advertisers will need to set this up manually in their analytics software or use  a dedicated attribution tool. Online surveys  Instead of using complex attribution models, advertisers could simply ask users how they found their website. Although this is a very simple approach, it can provide valuable insights that you might not get with attribution  models. Advertisers can implement online surveys at three different levels:  ● When a user fills out the purchase or sign-up form or on the confirmation page.",769,127,192.25
533,267,"● When a user is browsing your website, open a discreet sidebar pop-up asking them to fill out a survey  (you could offer a coupon code as an incentive). ● When the user is leaving the website, open a pop-up survey. Even though not every user will fill out a survey or just select a random field, advertisers will still have enough  data to compare the survey results with their attribution and traffic source data. 274",419,78,104.75
534,268,"Coupons  Coupons have been around for decades but their popularity and effectiveness for attributing conversions is still  strong. By using coupons in their marketing materials, advertisers can attribute conversions to specific offline  channels, often with more accuracy than with attribution models and technology platforms. Coupons work best with direct mail campaigns and other printed advertising materials, but it’s a good idea to  issue unique coupons per campaign, and when possible, per client. Zip/Postal codes  Collecting zip codes from online customers can be used to measure different offline campaigns, such as direct  mail and out-of-home campaigns. Although this method won’t be very accurate — you won’t know for certain whether someone with a certain zip  code was influenced by your campaign — it can be used in conjunction with the models listed above for  improved accuracy.",895,143,223.75
535,268,"This approach would really only make sense for ecommerce stores, or companies that have an offline and  online store, as they collect billing and delivery information during the purchase process. Online-Offline Attribution  Let’s now look at a few ways advertisers can attribute online activity, such as ad views and clicks, to offline  purchases in a store. Beacons  Beacons are bluetooth-enabled devices that can transmit signals to and from mobile devices such as  smartphones and tablets. When placed in brick-and-mortar stores, they can be used to send push notifications to devices in a certain  radius and collect data about the device itself. The latter can help attribute online activity, such as ad clicks and  mobile app activity, to offline purchases.",763,126,190.75
536,268,"Zip/postal codes at POS  You read a moment ago about how advertisers can use zip codes to attribute offline ads to online conversions,  but they can also be used in reverse. One of the most common ways to collect zip codes from customers is by asking for them at point of sale  (POS). Advertisers could then match the zip codes in store with the location data in the online ad campaign reports. Similarly with the use of zip codes for offline and online attribution, this approach is not very accurate and is  best used as an addition to other attribution methods. 275",568,106,142.0
537,269,"The Multi-Device Consumer Journey And The Technological Challenges It  Presents  In the early days of online advertising, the online customer journey was undertaken on one device —  predominantly desktops / laptops.

The chart illustrates global device usage between mobile devices (e.g. smartphones), desktops and laptops,  and tablets. Source: statcounter GlobalStats  This new generation of multi-device users has given rise to the cross-device customer journey.

539,270,"However, the growing number of privacy changes in web browsers and mobile devices mean that collecting  attribution data is becoming a lot harder. As we’ve seen in this chapter, attribution is an important component of improving the effectiveness of ad  campaigns. But there are areas of the online advertising industry that significantly and negatively impact the  performance and cost of online advertising campaigns, with ad fraud and viewability being 2 classic  examples. 277",480,77,120.0
540,271,"13. Ad Fraud and Viewability  Although the advancement of technology and growth of digital advertising has helped publishers increase  revenue and allowed advertisers to reach more of their audience, it has also given rise to some very costly  problems for all companies involved in digital advertising. Two such problems are ad fraud and issues around ad viewability. Ad Fraud  Ad fraud in digital advertising is a multi-billion dollar problem. There are many types of ad fraud, but they all  work by misrepresenting advertising metrics, such as impressions, clicks, and conversions for monetary gain.",602,98,150.5
541,272,"The Cost of Ad Fraud  Numerous studies show that ad fraud costs the digital advertising industry between US $26 billion and US $42  billion a year. To put that into perspective, global digital ad spend in 2019 was estimated to be US $333.25  billion . Below are some figures from recent studies into the cost of ad fraud. $26 billion : CHEQ, an ad fraud solution, found that ad fraud could cost the online advertising industry US $26  billion in 2020. $42 billion to $100 billion: Juniper networks estimates that ad fraud cost advertisers US $42 billion in 2019,  with this number rising to US $100 billion by 2023.",615,114,153.75
542,272,10% to 30% : The World Federation of Advertisers estimates that 10% to 30% of advertising is not seen by  consumers because of ad fraud and problems with ad viewability. Determining the true cost and scale of ad fraud is difficult because:  1. It can be very hard to detect fraudulent activity due to the sophistication of the ad fraud techniques. 2. The technology to protect advertisers is constantly stuck in a game of cat and mouse with fraudsters.,452,81,113.0
543,272,3. Most ad fraud goes undetected and many companies choose not to publicly disclose the fact that  they’ve been impacted by it. All these factors mean that the actual impact of ad fraud may be higher than what is reported. There are a number of reasons why this figure is so huge:  1. Fraudsters follow the money .,314,60,78.5
544,272,"Ad fraud moves from one lucrative area to another. The increase in ad  spend has attracted more fraudulent behavior. You’ll often see an increase in ad fraud in emerging  areas of digital advertising, such as mobile in-app and OTT/CTV (more on this below). 2. Digital advertising is less regulated than the financial industries , meaning it’s easier for fraudsters  to get away with their criminal activities.",409,69,102.25
545,272,"3. The digital advertising ecosystem is fragmented and complex , which makes it easier for fraudsters  to conceal their activity. The Main Types of Ad Fraud  What makes online ad fraud so challenging is that there are several ways to steal money from advertisers and  publishers, with new ad fraud methods being created all the time. The most common ad fraud techniques include:  Invisible and Hidden Ads  With this ad fraud technique, ads will be invisible or hidden on websites, but an impression will still be  recorded. 279",527,94,131.75
546,273,"There a few ways fraudsters can carry out this technique:  ● Display an ad in a 1×1 pixel iframe. ● Display ads outside of the viewport area. ● Display (multiple) re-sized ads. ● Display several ads in an iframe loaded to a single ad slot so that out of all the ads loaded, only one will  actually be visible to the user. This is also known as ad stacking.",356,71,89.0
547,273,"This technique is not the same as non-viewable impressions (see below) whereby ads are displayed on a  website and recorded but aren’t seen by a user because they’re at the bottom of the page where the user  doesn’t scroll to. Domain Spoofing  Domain spoofing involves a fraudulent website disguising itself as a genuine and often premium website. Some fraudulent AdTech platforms can also carry out domain spoofing. Brands pay high CPMs to display their ads on premium websites or websites where their target audience is, so  by disguising itself as one of these websites, fraudsters can take the ad revenue that should have gone to the  real website. Ad Injection  Also known as hijacked ads, this type of ad fraud injects ads into unsuspecting websites, usually via malicious  browser plugins or mobile apps.",811,140,202.75
548,273,"Ad injection can be done in a few ways:  ● Compromising the user’s computer to change the DNS resolver — e.g. by resolving the  ad.doubleclick.com domain to the IP of the server controlled by the attacker and therefore serving  different ads. ● Compromising the publisher’s website or the user’s computer to change the HTML content on the fly —  e.g. changing ad tags placed by the publisher to tags controlled by the attacker. ● Compromising the user’s proxy server or router (or the ISP’s router) to spoof the DNS server or change  the HTML content of the site on the fly. Click Injection  Click injection, also known as hijacked clicks, is a similar technique to ad injection, but instead of injecting ads  into a web page, fraudsters will inject clicks. The way fraudsters make money is by receiving money for the  click and also the conversion.",849,154,212.25
549,273,"So instead of the commission for a conversion going to a genuine publisher or mobile app, it would go to the  fraudster as their fake click would be recorded as the last touch before the conversion. Cookie Stuffing  The cookie-stuffing technique is used to steal money from CPA or affiliate marketing campaigns. 280",315,55,78.75
550,274,"Because cookies are often used to attribute conversions, fraudsters will stuff a user’s browser with cookies  they’ve either created themselves or have stolen from other publishers. This allows them to receive  commissions from affiliate networks when a user completes a conversion on a publisher’s websites (e.g.  purchases a product). How Ad Fraud Is Carried Out  The above types of ad fraud can be carried out in many ways:  Bot traffic : Non-human traffic generated by botnets, which consist of compromised computers, cloud servers,  and proxy servers. This type of traffic is often referred to as sophisticated invalid traffic (SIVT). Click farms and device farms: A collection of devices (laptops and mobile phones) used to generate  fraudulent impressions, clicks, and conversions (e.g. app installs).",808,130,202.0
551,274,"These farms are sometimes operated by  humans or via programs installed on the devices. Methbot and 3ve  Although there are many botnets and types of malware, the most costly botnets ever discovered are Methbot  and 3ve. These botnets were elaborate and sophisticated operations that stole an estimated US $36 million from  advertisers between 2014 and 2018. Ad fraud is rarely investigated by law enforcement, but in November 2018 the US Department of Justice (DoJ)  issued a release saying it has indicted 8 people over the Methbot and 3ve schemes. The investigation is the largest criminal investigation into ad fraud that has ever taken place and involved the  FBI, the US Department of Homeland Security, and private companies including Google and White Ops.",763,128,190.75
552,274,"Ad Fraud in Emerging Areas of Digital Advertising  Although ad fraud began in the display advertising world, it has moved into other emerging areas of digital  advertising such as mobile in-app and OTT/CTV. Mobile In-App Ad Fraud  Many of the ad fraud techniques used in web browsers are also found in mobile in-app environments. But there  are a few that are specific to mobile in-app. App or SDK spoofing: Similar to domain spoofing, this technique tricks advertisers into thinking that their ad  will appear in a premium app, when it will actually appear in a fraudulent app. Ad stacking: Ads are placed on top of one another so the app earns more ad revenue, but only one ad is  displayed to the user.",705,129,176.25
553,274,"Click injection: Just like click injection in web browsers, fraudsters collect ad revenue and affiliate  commissions for clicks they didn’t generate themselves. 281",164,24,41.0
554,275,"Hidden ads: Fraudsters run ads in the background of apps, giving off the impression that they are being  displayed to users when they aren’t. Malware: Malicious apps that carry out one or more of the above techniques to generate fraudulent ad  revenue. OTT & CTV  The over-the-top (OTT) and connected TV (CTV) industries are ripe for ad fraud; they are emerging and  growing areas of digital advertising with higher CPMs than other channels, there’s no direct connection  between buyers and sellers, there’s a lack of transparency, and brands are pouring more money into them. Pixalate, an ad fraud intelligence and marketing compliance company, recently uncovered two ad fraud  schemes in the OTT/CTV environment. Pixalate has named these schemes DiCaprio and Monarch .",770,128,192.5
555,275,"The DiCaprio ad fraud scheme used similar techniques found in web browsers and mobile apps to fool  advertisers into thinking that they were bidding on inventory on Roku devices. It seems that fraudsters compromised the security of the popular social networking app Grindr to send out ad  requests via a script, which contained the name DiCaprio. The ad requests appeared to come from Roku apps on Roku devices. Advertisers would bid on these ad  requests believing their ads would be shown to Roku users, when in fact they would run in the background  inside the Grindr app. The Monarch scheme used a spoofing technique to make it appear that ads would be displayed on premium  Roku apps, when actually they would end up on non-premium apps like screensavers.",760,133,190.0
556,275,"Unlike the DiCaprio  scheme that involved mobile devices, the Monarch scheme was contained to Roku apps and devices. In another ad-fraud scheme, known as Icebucket , detected by bot-mitigation company White Ops, fraudsters  impersonated more than 2 million people and generated 1.9 billion ad requests on OTT/CTV and mobile  devices. The scheme used a botnet to produce artificial viewing activity on edge devices (mainly mobile and CTV  devices). How Advertisers And Publishers Can Defend Against Ad Fraud  Combating ad fraud is an ongoing battle, but there are a couple of things publishers, brands, agencies, and  AdTech companies can do to reduce ad fraud. 1.",663,110,165.75
557,275,Use Ad Fraud Detection Software  There are several software companies that detect and prevent many of the ad fraud techniques listed above  for different advertising channels. Many AdTech companies also provide ad-fraud detection features as part of  their offering. Below are some of the main cybersecurity and ad-fraud detection companies:  282,346,55,86.5
558,276,"2. Adopt IAB standards  Over the past few years, the IAB have produced a number of standards to help reduce ad fraud in web  browsers and mobile apps. These include ads.txt , app-ads.txt , and sellers.json . Authorized digital sellers (ads.txt)  Ads.txt aims to tackle domain spoofing (a type of ad fraud) and arbitrage, which is a process where  impressions are bought and then repackaged and resold at a higher price by a third party. Ads.txt helps to  solve this problem by indicating who the authorized sellers and resellers of a publisher’s inventory are.",560,99,140.0
559,276,"To adopt the standard, a publisher adds an ads.txt file containing information about all the programmatic  partners (supply-side platforms, ad exchanges, ad networks, etc.)they work with to their web server and host it  under their root domain. 283",248,40,62.0
560,277,"Advertisers or AdTech companies can then use a script to crawl the web (or a database of domains) to collect  the ads.txt files from publishers. Advertisers can then reference a publisher’s ads.txt file against IDs in OpenRTB bid requests. If there’s a  match, then advertisers can be assured that they are buying inventory from genuine publishers. 284",352,59,88.0
561,278,"You can see whether a publisher has an ads.txt file and view the contents of it by adding /ads.txt to the end of  a root domain, e.g. businessinsider.com/ads.txt and cnn.com/ads.txt. Here’s a breakdown of the information in the above ads.txt entry:  AdTech partner – The AdTech platform, typically supply-side platforms and ad exchanges, the publisher uses  to sell their inventory. Examples include google.com appnexus.com , bidfluence.com , rubiconproject.com and  pubmatic.com . Seller Account ID – This represents the publisher’s account ID for the respective AdTech vendors and is used  to verify the authenticity of the inventory during RTB auctions. Direct or reseller – Direct means that the publisher works directly with the AdTech vendor to sell its inventory.",770,123,192.5
562,278,"Reseller means that the publisher has authorized another company to sell its inventory on its behalf. For  example, SSP2 (reseller) could sell the publisher’s inventory via SSP1 (direct). Certification Authority ID – This optional field represents the advertising system within a certification  authority, for example, the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG). Inventory type – Some publishers include this optional field so they know which type of inventory the AdTech  vendor sells (view cnn.com/ads.txt to see examples). As this hashtag represents a comment, it won’t be picked  up by the crawling script unless certain configurations are made to it, but as this is purely for the publisher’s  benefit, there’s no real need for buyers to have this information.",765,121,191.25
563,278,"Authorized digital sellers for apps (app-ads.txt)  App-ads.txt is the mobile app version of ads.txt, but with a few differences in the setup. To adopt app-ads.txt, app developers need to provide a developer website URL in app store listings and  publish an app-ads.text file. App stores are also encouraged to publish three HTML <meta> tags with the store  listing page for each individual app to allow advertisers and AdTech companies to match the bundle_id and/or  store_id in bid requests. Here’s an example of the three HTML meta tags provided by the IAB:  <meta name=""appstore:developer_url"" content=""https://www.path.to/page"" />  <meta name=""appstore:bundle_id"" content=""com.example.myapp"" />  <meta name=""appstore:store_id"" content=""SKU12345"" />  285",757,112,189.25
564,279,"Advertisers and AdTech companies then need to crawl app listing pages in app stores to retrieve these three  HTML meta tags, translate the developer URL to an app-ads.txt path, and then crawl the web for the  app-ads.txt file and interpret them. Ads.cert  Ads.cert is considered a more secure version of ads.txt and aims to increase transparency into programmatic  ad buying by providing cryptographically signed bid requests. By doing so, media buyers can be sure that the  information being sent in the bid request (e.g. the publisher’s URL, user’s location, user’s IP, and user’s device)  is factual. 286",607,103,151.75
565,280,"Here’s how the process works, step by step (steps based on the IAB Tech Lab’s documentation ):  1. OpenSSL’s security software is used by the publisher to generate a pair of ECDSA keys based on the  bid request:  ○ Public (secured, yet accessible, to be read by systems which validate the bid request against  the signatures). The Public Key file must be shared via HTTP and/or HTTPS from the  287",397,75,99.25
566,281,"publisher’s website under a relative path on the server: /ads.cert. Although ads.cert is referred  to as a file, the resource does not need to come from a file system. ○ Private (secret, secure, and inaccessible to outside systems, yet accessible to the systems that  generate and sign bid requests, e.g. SSP). Private keys are in a standard format known to  compatible security packages. 2.",391,67,97.75
567,281,"An encrypted signature based on the bid request is generated with a private key and attached to the bid  request and sent out on behalf of the publisher by an SSP, with details about the impression available,  publisher’s website or app, industry, language, etc. 3. The recipient of the request will then use the public key to generate another signature for that same bid  request. 4. The signatures generated by the publisher and by the recipient are compared to check if they were  generated based on the same bid request (created using a matching pair of keys).",564,101,141.0
568,281,"If yes, then the bid  request is considered legit. Any alterations of the signed elements can be detected by the recipient or  other servers in the chain. The main drawback of ads.cert is that it’s only available with OpenRTB 3.0, which is not currently supported by  a majority of AdTech platforms. Sellers.json and the OpenRTB Supply Chain Object  Sellers.json allows media buyers to see all the sellers and resellers involved in a bid request. In many ways,  sellers.json is an extension to ads.txt.",502,88,125.5
569,281,"So instead of just seeing a list of authorized sellers and resellers in an  ads.txt file, sellers.json lists the final seller of a bid request. The OpenRTB Supply Chain Object is part of sellers.json and provides a record of all the sellers (direct) and  resellers that have been involved in bid requests. By viewing all of the entities (referred to as nodes) involved in bid requests, media buyers can get more  transparency into the supply chain, identify whether the entities are partners they want to work with, and see  how many entities the bid passed through before it was delivered to publishers. Ad Viewability  Ad viewability refers to whether an ad was seen by a human or not. Although non-viewable ads can be a result of ad fraud, such as if a publisher uses bots to generate  impressions, in most cases the reason is not sinister, for example if an ad is located at the bottom of a page  where a user doesn’t scroll to.",932,172,233.0
570,281,"Ad viewability is one of the biggest issues in today’s online advertising world with some sources stating that  over half of all ads served are not actually viewed by an online user. A large majority of AdTech platforms do a pretty good job of determining whether an ad has been served and  whether an ad has been clicked on, but determining whether an ad was actually viewed by a user can be hard  to measure. 288",414,79,103.5
571,282,"The current industry standard provided by IAB and the Media Rating Council (MRC) states that for an ad to be  registered as viewed, it needs to have met these two criteria:  Source: MRC Viewable Ad Impression Measurement Guidelines, Version 1.0 (Final) – June 30, 2014  https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/#mrcviewable  For display ads: 50% of the ad’s pixel needs to be in the web browser’s viewport for a minimum of 1 second. For video ads: 50% of the ad’s pixel needs to be in the web browser’s viewport for a minimum of 2 seconds. Viewable Impressions  As we saw in the ad server chapter, impression trackers are used by both advertisers and publishers to track  the number of impressions an ad receives. However, this only tracks impressions that are served; it doesn’t tell us if the ad was actually viewed by a user. So not only do you need to track the number of impressions served, you also need to determine if the  impression was actually seen by a real user.",992,174,248.0
572,282,"Ads may be served but not viewed because of one or more of the following reasons:  ● The ad may have taken too long to load, leaving a blank space where the ad should have been. ● The user could have scrolled down or switched tabs or windows before an ad could be displayed to  them. ● The user could be using an ad-blocking plugin like AdBlockPlus, uBlock, or Ghostery. ● There might have been some technical issues with the webpage or web browser. Also, there are a number of fraudulent long-tail sites that perform all kinds of tricks to record an ad impression,  when in fact, the ads could never be seen on the page at all.",628,121,157.0

Typically, these sites will monetize their site with Google AdSense and the inventory on these sites is  known as long-tail inventory. A lot of hope is placed in the so-called viewable impression. The idea behind viewable impression is pretty straightforward:  An advertiser pays only for ad impressions that were actually seen by a user.",438,72,109.5

577,284,"14. User Privacy in Digital Advertising  Throughout history, advertising has followed the consumer through the invention and rise of new mediums,  from the print world to the online world. But the world of online advertising has brought with it a number of issues that have caused companies,  governments, and consumers to take a proactive approach to limiting the amount of user data that can be  collected. In this chapter, we’ll look at one of the biggest topics in programmatic advertising; user privacy . The Rise of Consumer Data Collection and Privacy Concerns  In the early days of online advertising, ad targeting was limited to the context of the page and information  passed to ad servers and ad networks in the user agent string (passed in a HTTP header) by web browsers,  such as:  ● The language set on the user’s computer.",837,149,209.25

Nowadays, user data can be collected in several ways and combined with data collected from different sources  to improve ad targeting, measurement, attribution and conduct frequency capping. The amount of user data collected by AdTech and data companies has increased significantly over the years,  which has given rise to concerns about how companies are collecting this data and what they are doing with it.

Many are also worried that their privacy is being invaded and exploited by online advertising companies.",521,86,130.25
580,285,"In this section, we’ll look at the various privacy and data laws in the US and Europe. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as it’s known in official  contexts, is a regulation spearheaded by the three legislative European Union institutions: the European  Parliament, European Commission, and Council of the European Union. It replaced the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) when it came into force on May 25, 2018. The GDPR aims to protect the data and privacy of citizens and residents of the European Union member  states  (highlighted in light blue). Even though Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein (highlighted in dark blue) are not EU  member states, they are European Economic Area (EEA) members and are also included in the GDPR.",851,138,212.75
581,286,"Key Terms of the GDPR  Below are three key terms that relate to online advertising and marketing: data subject , data controller , and  data processor . 293",156,30,39.0
582,287,"Data Subject  The GDPR defines a data subject as a natural person whose personal data is processed by a controller or  processor. In the context of digital advertising, a data subject is an EU or EEA citizen or resident whose data can be  collected by AdTech companies. Data Controller  A data controller is any person or company that collects data about EU citizens and residents. Examples include publishers, ecommerce stores, individual bloggers, brands, and companies that collect data  about users either directly or indirectly via another company. Data Processor  A data processor is any person or company that provides services or technology and collects data on behalf of  data controllers.",698,117,174.5
583,287,"Examples include AdTech and MarTech vendors. Personal, Pseudonymous, and Anonymous Data  Another key term in the GDPR is personal data . In simple terms, if a piece of information, either separately or combined with other pieces of data, can be used  to identify a person, then it’s classed as personal data. 294",312,54,78.0
584,288,"‘Personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’);  an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to  an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more  factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that  natural person. Article 4 (1)  GDPR  Identity in this sense doesn’t just refer to knowing a person’s name, it also refers to identification. This means if a user visits your website or sees one of your ads, they are considered identifiable if you can  later recognize them, e.g. by identifying and recognizing them via their cookie ID or other identifier, if they  return to your website or see another one of your ads. The same principle applies to singling out an individual based on several data points, such as their postal  code, gender, and age. In this case, even though you don’t know the person’s name or have an identifier, e.g.  a user ID in a cookie saved in their browser, you could still potentially identify them.",1184,204,296.0
585,288,"In the past, AdTech vendors and most MarTech vendors have based their privacy policies on the fact that they  are not collecting or dealing with personal data because online identifiers, such as cookie IDs, IP addresses,  device advertising IDs, and device fingerprints were not considered examples of personal data. However, under the GDPR, any piece of data or information that can in some way identify a person is classed  as personal data. Apart from personal data, the GDPR also refers to two other types of data: pseudonymous and anonymous . Pseudonymous data refers to data that’s been changed into a non-identifiable format, rendering it unable to  identify a person without the use of additional data, such as the hashing function or encryption keys. ‘Pseudonymization’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no  longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such  additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure  that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.",1175,193,293.75
586,288,"Article 4 (5)  GDPR  Anonymous data means that it can’t be used to identify a person, which, for this reason, offers little value to  online advertising and marketing companies as they are in the business of identifying people and targeting  them with ads and marketing messages. 295",283,51,70.75
587,289,"Due to its inability to identify a person, anonymous data is not subject to the rules of the GDPR, meaning if a  company collects anonymous data, they don’t have to obtain user consent. ... The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information  which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous  in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not, therefore,  concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. Recital 26  GDPR  A Comparison of the Three Types of Data  Below is a comparison table that provides examples of personal, anonymous, and pseudonymous data.

591,290,"While that is true in most cases, it’s important to keep in mind that the anonymized data could still be linked to  an individual if enough pieces of data are combined together. For example, having a single data point, like an age range of 40–50, out of a sample size of 1,000 couldn’t be  linked to an individual, but when you add in other anonymized data sets (e.g. postcodes and the year of birth)  and combine with other sets of data (e.g. public records or data), it can easily become personal data and could  be used to identify an individual. 297",553,105,138.25
592,291,"Did you know? There have been a number of situations of anonymized data becoming re-identifiable, with one example  being Netflix’s 2006 contest in which the company put up a $1 million prize for the person or team who could  significantly improve their recommendation algorithm. As part of the content, Netflix released 10 million  movie rankings by 500,000 customers, which included the following information:  ● A unique subscriber ID  ● Movie title  ● Year of release  ● The date on which the subscriber rated the movie  Even though personally identifiable information, such as customer name, was replaced with a unique ID, two  researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, were able to  de-anonymize some of the data and identify certain users by comparing user ratings and the date on which  they rated the movies with information from the site Internet Movie Database (IMDB). A Side Note About Sensitive Data  The GDPR also includes another type of data class: sensitive data . Examples of sensitive data include religious or philosophical beliefs, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,  trade-union membership, and data concerning health, sex life, and sexual orientation.",1231,205,307.75
593,291,"Sensitive data is typically not collected by advertisers or marketers as it requires stronger grounds for  processing and is subject to additional protections, meaning the payoff just isn’t viable. Advertisers and marketers wishing to collect, store, and use sensitive data should be aware that they will need  to obtain explicit consent from the data subject. What Does This Mean for AdTech From a Technical Perspective? The definition of personal data is somewhat unchanged from the definition given in the Directive; however, it  broadened the scope of the data-protection law. One example of the change in scope is that the GDPR now considers online identifiers and location data as  personal data.",702,114,175.5
594,291,"As most online advertisers, marketers, and publishers collect and use online identifiers, such as those  mentioned above, as well as location data, they will now have to take additional steps to ensure they are  compliant with the GDPR’s rules regarding the collection, storage, and usage of personal data. Examples of personal data include:  ● Names  ● Email, home, and work addresses  298",390,67,97.5
595,292,"● Phone numbers  ● Cookie IDs (visitor identifiers stored in cookies)  ● IP addresses  ● Device IDs  ● Device fingerprints  The GDPR states that companies collecting personal data should implement measures to ensure the data is  protected at all times, for instance, via encryption and pseudonymization. Although most companies already do this with obvious examples of personal data, such as emails, phone  numbers, and IP addresses, they now have to apply this to all types of data they collect. While these measures will help online advertising and marketing companies mitigate risks associated with data  security, encrypted and pseudonymized data are still classed as personal data, meaning companies still have  to obtain user consent and carry out various data-protection measures if they wish to collect and use the  information. The main challenges advertising and marketing companies face with personal data are collecting it in the first  place (i.e. obtaining consent), ensuring its security, and creating a chain of responsibility with their partners  when they exchange data with them. The European Union’s ePrivacy Directive  The ePrivacy directive is a piece of EU legislation that also aims to protect the data and privacy of EU and EEA  citizens and residents, but with a focus on respecting their private lives when using electronic communications.",1366,224,341.5
596,292,"Within the online advertising and marketing industries, the current ePrivacy directive is often conversationally  referred to as the cookie law because it regulates the usage of cookies, among other identifiers. However, it relates to the protection of privacy in the electronic-communications sector as a whole, not just the  usage of cookies for online advertising and marketing. One of the most prominent consequences of the ePrivacy directive (officially known as the Privacy and  Electronic Communications Directive, 2002/58/EC) is the cookie-consent notices — also known as cookie  bars — like the one below from bbc.co.uk:  A common identifier of the current EU ePrivacy directive is the cookie-information banners displayed to EU  citizens, which will likely be superseded by a new user-consent form under the GDPR and ePrivacy  regulations. Currently, ePrivacy is a directive, but is in the process of being transformed into a regulation, which will also  repeal the current directive. 299",998,158,249.5
597,293,"Once adopted, ePrivacy will regulate the processes of placing, accessing, and using identification technologies  on users’ devices based on the broadened definition of personal data as recognized by the GDPR (e.g.  cookies, device advertising IDs, and IP addresses). It is not known when the ePrivacy regulation will come into force as the proposal is set to be negotiated  between the three EU legislative institutions (see below). Given that it is still in progress, the final version of the ePrivacy regulation may still affect how AdTech  platforms interact with online identifiers based on the GDPR itself and the current state of ePrivacy. What’s the difference between GDPR and ePrivacy? Both the GDPR and ePrivacy are based on Articles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a document  containing the rights and freedoms protected in the EU.",852,140,213.0
598,293,"The GDPR is based on Article 8 and relates to the protection of personal data, whereas ePrivacy is based on  Article 7 and relates to respect for private life. In simple terms, the GDPR is focused on data protection, and ePrivacy is focused on the right to respect a  data subject’s private and family life, home, and communications. Also, ePrivacy is lex specialis of the GDPR, meaning that when the two regulations cover the same situation,  ePrivacy will override the GDPR. The Current State of ePrivacy  In December 2016, a draft of the proposed ePrivacy regulation was leaked, with the first official draft formally  released by the European Commission in January 2017. On October 19, 2017, the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (aka  LIBE Committee) voted to approve an amended version of the ePrivacy regulation.",863,146,215.75
599,293,"This amended version was  then approved by members of the European Parliament during a plenary session (a meeting of the whole  Parliament). Another draft was released in March 2019, with subsequent proposals released in March 2019 and November  2019 . The drafts have been met with some strong opposition from various advertising and marketing organizations,  including the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe (IAB Europe) and Digital Europe — whose members  include Google, Apple, Microsoft, and IBM — with their main concerns centered around the lawfulness of data  processing based on the notion of legitimate interest. 300",629,101,157.25

604,295,"Also, the CCPA allows affected consumers to take individual or class-action lawsuits against offending  businesses, which should be a more serious financial concern for potential violators. Damages range between  $100 and $750 – or more, if actual damages are proven. The Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Personal Data  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a term regularly used in AdTech, but it extends well past this industry. In fact, PII is often referenced by US government agencies, such as the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) . NIST provides the following definition of PII:  PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be  used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of  birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an  individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.",1060,168,265.0
605,295,"A very similar definition is provided by US Government’s Office of Management and Budget :  The term “personally identifiable information” refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an  individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc.alone, or when  combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such  as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. What Pieces of Information are Considered PII? PII can be divided into two categories: linked information and linkable information . Linked information is any piece of personal information that can be used to identify an individual and includes,  but is not limited to, the following:  ● Full name  ● Home address  ● Email address  ● Social security number  ● Passport number  ● Driver’s license number  ● Credit card numbers  ● Date of birth  ● Telephone number  ● Internet protocol (IP) address  Linkable information, on the other hand, is information that on its own may not be able to identify a person, but  when combined with another piece of information could identify, trace, or locate a person.",1187,206,296.75
606,296,"Here are some examples of linkable information:  ● First or last name (if common)  ● Country, state, city, postcode  ● Gender  ● Race  ● Non-specific age (e.g. 30-40 instead of 30)  ● Job position and workplace  Non-PII  There’s a lot of grey area around whether identifiers like cookie IDs and device IDs are examples of PII or  non-PII. While the definition of PII doesn’t include a specific reference to cookie IDs or device IDs, the Guide to  Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the NIST suggests that they are  classed as PII (emphasis ours):  Asset information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) address or other  host-specific persistent static identifier that consistently links to a particular person or small,  well-defined group of people . However, many AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers class cookie IDs and device IDs as non-PII. 303",931,160,232.75
607,297,"One could argue that cookie IDs and device IDs can be deleted or reset and therefore aren’t persistent forever,  but the same could be said for other types of PII such as home addresses, email addresses, and password  numbers that can change more than once during a person’s life. The Definition of Personal Data  As we mentioned above in the section about the GDPR, personal data is a term used in the European Union to  define a piece of information that can be used to identify a person. Examples of personal data include:  ● Names  ● Email, home, and work addresses  ● Phone numbers  ● Cookie IDs (visitor identifiers stored in cookies)  ● IP addresses  ● Device IDs  ● Device fingerprints  What’s the Difference Between PII and Personal Data? While PII is a commonly recognized term, there is another term that many people may be familiar with —  personal data. The difference between PII and personal data can be explained by the following:  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a term used mainly within the USA.",1027,189,256.75

Browser Settings  Although popular web browsers have long provided some level of privacy protection in the form of DoNotTrack ,  few have implemented technical settings to strengthen user privacy when browsing the web. 304",411,71,102.75
609,298,"But this has all changed over the past few years with the most popular web browsers by market share —  Google Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox, and Apple’s Safari — making gradual changes to how their web browsers  handle cookies and other storage and tracking methods (e.g. device fingerprinting) to strengthen privacy for  users. Let’s now take a look at how web browsers have strengthened user privacy and the impact these changes  have had on digital advertising. Apple’s Safari  Apple’s first real initiative to strengthen user privacy came in 2015 when they allowed iOS users to install  content blockers (a form of ad blocking). These content blockers can be downloaded from the App Store and used to prevent certain content (e.g. ads)  and tracking cookies from loading in the Safari web browser on Apple smartphones and tablets. Then, in September 2017, Apple stepped up their privacy game by introducing Intelligent Tracking Prevention  (ITP) with the release of Safari 11 and iOS 11.",987,168,246.75
610,298,"ITP is a feature of Webkit, an open-source web-browser engine that powers Apple’s Safari web browser, that  aims to further protect users’ online privacy by changing the way Safari handles user identification methods,  such as first- and third-party cookies. The way ITP works is by classifying domains that are capable of tracking users across different domains via its  Machine Learning Classifier. Since its initial release, ITP has strengthened user privacy by limiting the lifespan of cookies and other data  storage methods with every new update. Here’s an overview of the main restrictions ITP places on cookies and other browser storage methods as per  ITP 2.3:  ● Third-party cookies are blocked by default. ● First-party cookies created by JavaScript’s Document.cookie API are set to expire in 7 days.",811,133,202.75
611,298,"● First-party cookies created by JavaScript’s Document.cookie API, classified as a tracking domain by the  Machine Learning Classifier, and created via a link containing a query string or id fragment (known as  link decoration) are set to expire in 24 hours. ● Data stored in local storage is set to expire in 7 days. ● All cookies created by a third-party CNAME-cloaked HTTP response will be set to expire in 7 days. ● In 2021, ITP will add a new feature that will hide a user’s IP address from trackers. How Does Intelligent Tracking Prevention Impact Digital Advertising?",574,100,143.5
612,298,The main problem companies in the digital advertising industry face when it comes to ITP is that it’s harder to  identify users across different websites. The ability to identify a person across different websites is important for the following reasons:  305,258,43,64.5
613,299,"1. Monetization for publishers: The more a publisher knows about a visitor, the more ad revenue it will  receive from advertisers, as we explain in the next point. 2. Revenue for advertisers: Advertisers want to reach a specific audience, and if a member of that audience  accesses a publisher’s site, they’ll likely submit a high bid in hopes their ad will be shown to them. 3.",378,68,94.5

Attribution: One of the most overlooked areas of this whole identity problem is attribution. It’s estimated that  global digital ad spend in 2019 will reach $316 billion , and without an accurate way to identify users as they  move across the Internet and devices, it will be hard to track performance and know where to assign budgets.

Nobody,  including Apple or the network provider, can read the information being passed. Here is Apple’s explanation on how its Private Relay works :  All the user’s requests are then sent through two separate internet relays.",571,94,142.75
616,299,The first assigns the user an  anonymous IP address that maps to their region but not their actual location. The second decrypts the web  address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. This separation of information protects the  user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit. Mail Privacy Protection  This feature will prevent email senders from using invisible pixels to identify when a user opens an email. It will  also mask a user’s IP address so that it can’t be used to determine their location or linked with other online  activity.,613,110,153.25
617,299,Hide My Mail  The Hide My Mail feature will allow users to use a unique and randomly generated email address instead of  using their actual email address. The newly generated email address will forward to the user’s personal email address and users can create and  delete as many “hidden” email addresses as they like. 306,322,58,80.5

Mail Privacy Protection will likely disrupt how email automation and MarTech tools work as they won’t be able  to report on open rates. The Hide My Mail feature will throw a spanner in the works for ID graphs and ID solutions built around email  addresses. As these changes will only apply to iCloud+ subscriptions, not every Apple user will be covered by these  changes. According to a group of Barclays analysts , Apple has around 850 million iCloud users, with about 170 million of  those users on paid subscriptions, which accounts for 20% of all iCloud subscribers.",832,144,208.0

622,303,"Chrome’s Better Ads Standards  On February 15, 2018, Chrome released a built-in filter that blocks ads that don’t comply with the Better Ads  Standards proposed by the Coalition for Better Ads formed by leading associations and companies (including  Google and Facebook ). The coalition’s goal is to improve consumers’ experiences with online ads. The filter does not get rid of ads completely (like a regular ad blocker), but protects the user from the most  disruptive ads. The filtered ads, according to www.betterads.org , include certain types of desktop ads:  ● Pop-up ads  ● Auto-playing videos with sound  ● Prestitial ads with a countdown  ● Large sticky ads  The types of mobile ad experiences least preferred by consumers and not complying by Better Ads Standard  for ads on mobile devices include:  ● Pop-up ads  ● Prestitial ads  ● Mobile pages with more than 30% ad density  ● Flashing animations  ● Postitial ads that require a countdown to dismiss  ● Full-screen scrollover ads  ● Large sticky ads  ● Auto-playing videos with sound  310",1052,190,263.0
623,304,"The Chrome filter is switched on by default and works in the following way:  ● A Chrome user opens a new page. ● Chrome’s ad filter first checks the page against a list of sites that notoriously fail the Better Ads  Standards . ● If the page is blacklisted, all requests for JavaScript ad tags or images ads will be blocked and won’t be  displayed. To determine which requests are ad-related, Chrome uses EasyList patterns used by most  available ad blockers. From an Internet user’s perspective, when you open a website that is non-compliant with Better Ads  Standards, you will see something like this:  311",609,111,152.25

Ads that comply with Better Ads Standards will be displayed normally. According to the standards proposed by the Coalition for Better Ads , the following kinds of ads – unlike in the  case of using an ad blocker like Adblock Plus – will not be blocked by the Chrome filter:  ● Autoplay video ads (without sound)  ● Skippable prestitials  ● Ads that initiate up to 12 seconds of scroll lag to ensure you see them  ● Flashing ads  ● Side-rail takeover ads  Chrome’s SameSite Cookies  On Wednesday, October 23, 2019, Google Chrome released a detailed blog post explaining changes about  how cookies would be handled in the future. The changes aim to give Chrome users more control over deleting third-party cookies, while keeping first-party  cookies intact. In short, website developers have to include a new “ SameSite ” attribute (specifically, SameSite=None) when  setting a cookie to tell Chrome which cookies are to be used only by the current site or current URL that the  user is on, and which ones are cross-site cookies.",1157,207,289.25
625,305,"Developers will also have to add the ‘Secure’ attribute as cookies will only be set via HTTPS. Even though this attribute applies to Chrome, which was the first browser to support this attribute, it shouldn’t  cause any issues in other browsers that don’t support it. 312",271,47,67.75
626,306,"Setting cookies in this way will eventually help Chrome understand which ones are first party and which ones  are third party. In the future, Chrome could then ask users if they want to block third-party cookies. If the user says ‘yes’, then  cookies created with `SameSite=None` will be blocked. Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  On August 22, 2019, Google announced a new initiative that aims to make the web more privacy friendly, but  still allows online advertising to work in a limited capacity. This initiative is known as Privacy Sandbox.",538,92,134.5
627,306,"Google is quick to reiterate that blocking third-party cookies completely without providing a solid alternative  (like what Safari and Firefox have done) is detrimental to the future of the Internet (and the back pockets of  publishers). It also acknowledges that users are demanding more control over their privacy. Instead of blocking third-party cookies altogether, Privacy Sandbox provides a secure environment for  personalization while still protecting user privacy. Here are the key things to know about Privacy Sandbox:  ● It’s an open solution and Google has asked for feedback and input from other web browsers,  publishers, and advertising technology (AdTech) companies on how to advance it. ● It is being positioned as a new web standard, rather than a new privacy feature.",785,126,196.25
628,306,"● It will likely allow ads to still be relevant for users, but only anonymous and aggregated data would be  available to AdTech companies and advertisers. Also, a lot more user data will stay on the device,  instead of being passed on to AdTech companies. ● Google acknowledges that it can't go it alone and will require input and feedback from other companies  and organizations. ● It’s expected that Privacy Sandbox will go live in 2033. Chrome’s Plans to Kill Off Third-Party Cookies and the Move To Privacy Sandbox  On Tuesday the 14th of January, 2020, Google made an announcement that most people in the online  advertising industry never thought they would hear — Google will kill off third-party cookies by 2022.",720,127,180.0
629,306,"This announcement follows in the footsteps of their previous initiatives (listed above) and is the next step in  Google Chrome’s ongoing commitment to making the web a more privacy friendly place, while still allowing  companies, including Google, to earn money from online advertising. Here are the main things you need to know about this new announcement:  ● Google Chrome plans to stop supporting third-party cookies by 2022. ● It will run a series of trials in 2020 to see how conversion measuring and personalization can work  without using third-party cookies. This will involve using Privacy Sandbox (see above). ● The personalization element will probably be interest-based personalization on an aggregated level,  rather than 1:1 personalization that has stood as the holy grail for advertisers and marketers for over a  decade.",837,136,209.25
630,307,"● The ultimate goal will be to replace third-party cookies used for ad selection and measurement with  Privacy Sandbox. As they’ve stated previously, Google doesn’t see strict privacy features, like those seen by Safari and Firefox,  as the way forward for the Internet and online advertising. Google feels that these approaches only encourage companies to create workarounds and develop techniques  like device fingerprinting, which further diminish user privacy and provide little or no control. Just like with other sandboxes used in computer security, Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox will execute advertising  processes in a restricted environment, which is in stark contrast to how these processes are carried out today. There are three parts to Privacy Sandbox:  ● Replacing cross-site tracking processes — i.e. the ones currently powered by third-party cookies.",861,133,215.25
631,307,"● Phasing out third-party cookies by separating first-party and third-party cookies via the SameSite  attribute and turning off support for third-party cookies. ● Mitigating workarounds such as fingerprinting. On Thursday June 24, 2021, Google Chrome announced that it would be extending its planned sunset of  third-party cookies by 2 years. It’s currently expected that Chrome will shut off support for third-party cookies  starting from the middle of 2023. Although it’s still in development, Privacy Sandbox puts forward a completely new way of how online  advertising works, particularly around identification, ad targeting , and measurement .",648,99,162.0
632,307,"Identification in Privacy Sandbox  As part of its plans to improve user privacy, Privacy Sandbox won’t identify individual users. This also means  there probably won’t be an ID that replaces cookies — i.e. no browser IDs. This is the biggest change that the online advertising industry will have to get used to, as publishers, brands,  agencies, and AdTech vendors have built their businesses around identifying individuals across the web via  third-party cookies. Although many AdTech vendors will turn to other identifiers such as first-party cookies, it’s impossible to rule  out the possibility of Chrome limiting the use of first-party cookies and other techniques for identification, like  what Safari has done with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Ad Targeting in Privacy Sandbox  The ad-targeting options in Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox will be fairly similar to the ones available today, but  won't rely on user-level identification.",944,150,236.0
633,307,"The main ad targeting processes in Privacy Sandbox are contextual and first-party-data targeting ,  interest-based targeting via Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) , and remarketing (aka retargeting) . 314",207,30,51.75
634,308,"With this method, users will be displayed ads that match the context of the page they’re visiting, similar to how  contextual advertising works today. The only difference is that Privacy Sandbox will be responsible for informing AdTech platforms about the  context of the page, rather than the AdTech platforms themselves (e.g. via web crawlers and the user agent  string). 315",377,63,94.25
635,309,"With interest-based targeting, a user will be added to a group based on the websites they visit. Advertisers will  be able to target them based on the groups they belong to. 316",177,33,44.25
636,310,"The important thing to note here is that targeting will be done on a cohort level, meaning no user data will be  passed to AdTech platforms, just the name of the interest group they belong to. This new way of running  targeted ad campaigns is in stark contrast to how it’s done currently. Google Chrome announced on January 25, 2021, that it would make the FLoC API publicly available for testing  in March 2021, and begin testing FLoC in Google Ads in Q2 2021. These tests were released in most  countries, except for countries in Europe as Google is not yet sure if FLoC complies with the GDPR. Based on the tests Google’s ad teams have conducted using FLoC, it claims that advertisers can expect to see  at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising for  reaching in-market and affinity Google Audiences.",852,154,213.0
637,310,"Then, on January 25, 2022, Google announced that it would be sunsetting FLoC and replacing it with a new  initiative — Topics API . Topics will enable advertisers to show ads to users based on the websites they visit, rather than the cohort they  belong to. A classifier model will map website hostnames to topics and only subdomains and root domains will  be included and not the full URL. For example, the website football.news.com will have the topic of football  associated with it, but news.com/sport will have topics related to news.com associated with it. There are currently around 350 categories that will be included in the Topics API, but it’s likely that this number  will change.",692,121,173.0
638,312,"The remarketing (aka retargeting) method is similar to the interest-based targeting method above, with the  main difference being how the ad-decisioning process works. With interest-based targeting, advertisers can show ads to users based on the interest groups they belong to. With the remarketing method, the browser will send two ad requests to the AdTech platform — one containing  contextual information and one referencing the interest group that the user belongs to. The process Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox will use for remarketing is known as Two Uncorrelated Requests,  Then Locally-Executed Decision On Victory (TURTLEDOVE). The AdTech platform won’t know that these two ad requests are coming from the same user, hence the name  ‘two uncorrelated requests’.",765,118,191.25
639,312,"The reason for this is to make it hard for AdTech platforms to identify users by  connecting the time the two requests are sent. The interesting thing about this proposed approach is that many of the key ad-decisioning and even auction  mechanics will be conducted client side (i.e. in the Chrome browser) instead of server side by AdTech  platforms. Other Proposals in Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  Apart from the standards mentioned above, there are many others that have been put forward by Google and  other companies, including AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers. Some of these proposals include:  SPARROW: A proposal from Criteo in response to Chrome’s TURTLEDOVE. Dovekey: A follow-up proposal to Criteo’s SPARROW from various teams at Google.",757,124,189.25

Fenced Frames: An API proposal created by Google engineers that would allow ads on a web page to load  without the rest of the page knowing what ad is being displayed. The Fenced Frames API would be used to  communicate with other Privacy Sandbox standards, like TURTLEDOVE, to show interest-based ads.",706,118,176.5

644,314,"Secondly, Apple presented users with a choice about whether an app could use their location data. Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) Framework  During its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced that it would be introducing a series  of privacy changes in iOS, iPadOs, and tvOS. One of the main changes was to change how its mobile identifier (IDFA) is accessed by app developers,  AdTech companies, and mobile measurement platforms (MMPs). As of iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and tvOS 14.5, if app developers, AdTech companies, and MMPs want to collect  a user’s IDFA, they’ll have to obtain consent via Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) Framework. The framework involves showing users a message, similar to the one below, asking them if they can track  them across different apps.",798,127,199.5
645,315,"If users accept, then their IDFA will be collected. If they reject it, then the IDFA will still be collected but will be  zeroed out, making it useless from an identification point of view.

646,316,"Apple’s ATT framework has a very similar impact to the loss of third-party cookies in web browsers as it limits  cross-app identification. In turn, this makes personalized ad targeting, retargeting, measurement, and  attribution very limited. Although Apple hasn’t put forward a solution to ad targeting, it has released a solution for app install attribution  via its SKAdNetwork. Apple’s SKAdNetwork  Apple’s SKAdNetwork aims to provide conversion data to advertisers but without revealing any user-level or  device-level data. It’s Apple’s version of a privacy-friendly way to attribute app installs.",603,92,150.75
647,317,"A couple of points about the SKAdNetwork:  ● The IDFA won’t be passed to AdTech platforms or MMPs, even if the user has opted in. ● All attribution data will pass through SKAdNetwork and then onto the AdTech platform or MMP. In iOS  and iPadOS 15 onwards, advertisers will also be able to receive the postback information. ● SKAdNetwork will only attribute app installs (via the last-click model) and not view-through conversions. ● Campaign IDs are limited to 100 per AdTech platform (e.g. ad network or MMP).",510,89,127.5
648,317,"Apple’s Privacy Changes in iOS 15 and iPad 15  With the release of iOS 15, iPad 15, and watchOS 15, Apple will introduce a feature known as the App Privacy  Report. The App Privacy Report will give users more insights into how apps use things like their location, photos,  camera, microphone, and contacts. The report will show users how apps have accessed that information in the past 7 days and can deny access  to that information by changing the settings. The App Privacy Report will also show users which third-party domains the app has been contacting so that  users can see which companies their data is potentially being shared with. Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID)  Although Google hasn’t announced any significant changes to its Android advertising ID (AAID), it has hinted  at making some changes in the future .",830,146,207.5
649,317,"Google recently announced that it will require app developers to include privacy information in their Google  Play Store listings, similar to the privacy information displayed in Apple’s App Store listings. Then in July 2021, Google announced that it would stop passing on its AAID if the user had opted out of  personalized advertising. These changes went live with the release of Android 12 in the later part of 2021. While this is considered a privacy change, it’s not as stringent as the ones released by Apple. Ad Blockers  Ad blockers emerged in the mid-2000s and have risen in popularity over the past decade due in part to the  growing concerns over user privacy and the pure annoyance of some ads (e.g. popup ads).",723,127,180.75
650,317,"Although there are several ad-blocking methods, the most popular method by far is via web browser plugins  like AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, and uBlock. How Do Ad Blockers Work? Most ad-blocking plugins work by preventing JavaScript and other elements from loading. This is achieved by  adding domains used to serve ads to a blacklist and by identifying elements used for displaying ads, such as  class=”advertisement”, class=”banner_ad”, and alt=”ad” from loading. 324",464,73,116.0
651,318,"Because most ad blockers stop AdTech JavaScript tags from loading, they not only stop ads from being  displayed but also stop third-party cookies from being created. This means publishers miss out on ad revenue. To highlight how ad blockers work, below we illustrate the normal ad-serving process where an ad is sent from  an advertiser and displayed to a user on a website, and then how the process looks when an ad-blocking  plugin is used. 325",446,79,111.5
652,319,And here’s the same process but with an ad blocker:  Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what’s happening in the image above:  1. A user visits a website and the browser sends a request to the publisher’s web server asking for the  page’s content. 2. The publisher’s web server returns the HTML and it starts rendering the page’s content. 3.,342,62,85.5
653,319,"The ad blocker extension scans the HTML, and:  A. Blocks the requests to load external resources, such as an ad request to the ad server  domain (the ad request is not made). B. Hides certain HTML elements from appearing, such as class=’’ad’’. The Impact Ad Blockers Have On The Digital Advertising Industry  The impact of ad blockers on publishers is immediate, severe, and costly. It’s estimated that ad blockers will  c ost publishers $27 billion in lost ad revenue in 2020. 326",481,86,120.25

655,321,"Source: Growth of the Blocked Web 2020 PageFair Adblock Report, Blockthrough . What Can Publishers Do About Ad Blockers? When it comes to addressing the issue of ad blockers, publishers first need to find out if a user is using  ad-blocking software, and then use a variety of tactics to handle it. How can publishers detect if someone is using an ad blocker? Although it’s difficult to bypass ad-blocking software, it’s possible to determine whether someone is using an ad  blocker by testing whether particular elements of the page have been displayed.",554,94,138.5
656,321,"Typically, testing for the presence of an ad blocker involves adding a “bait” script — a tiny piece of code that an  ad blocker is likely to interpret as an ad — to the publisher’s website. This bait script could contain a class  name like “banner_ad”, which would likely be blocked by an ad blocker. Examples of bait scripts and anti-ad-blocking scripts  Ad-block-detection scripts that are based on the aforementioned “bait” method take just a couple lines of  code to implement. There are a few providers offering ready-made ad-block detecting scripts:  Detectadblock  Detectadblock.com proposes a method that requires a piece of JavaScript code to be saved. The method  involves a hidden <div> section saved to a file called “ads.js”, placed in the root directory of the website:  var e=document.createElement('div');  e.id='RZfrHsidDwbG';  e.style.display='none';  document.body.appendChild(e);  Publishers place the following JavaScript within their website’s HTML source code just above the </body>  tag.",1011,161,252.75
657,321,"Its purpose is to check if the hidden DIV created within “ads.js” exists (ads are allowed) or not (ads are  being blocked). <script src=""/ads.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>  <script type=""text/javascript"">  if(document.getElementById('RZfrHsidDwbG')){  alert('Blocking Ads: No');  } else {  alert('Blocking Ads: Yes');  }  </script>  IAB Script  The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), an advertising-business organization that develops industry  standards, runs its own tech lab and has also proposed its own ad-block-detection script. It creates a set of  “bait” DIVs likely to be blocked by browser-based ad-blocking tools. The script is really simple to set up, and  328",682,104,170.5
658,322,"the IAB runs its own Github page ( https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdBlockDetection ) where  you can find details about its inner workings. BlockAdBlock  BlockAdBlock is a community-developed anti-ad-blocking script. Similar to the aforementioned methods, it’s  very simple and effective. The bait used by BlockAdBlock looks like this:  baitClass: 'pub_300x250 pub_300x250m pub_728x90 text-ad textAd text_ad text_ads text-ads text-ad-links'  This means it will trigger ad-blocking software by referencing typical names and popular IAB-recommended  ad-image sizes: 300x250px, 300x250px, and the skyscraper 728x90px. All these strings are referenced in  Easylist.",677,90,169.25
659,322,"The script then detects whether the elements were displayed on the page. How can publishers deal with ad blockers? Detecting ad blockers is half the battle. Once a publisher determines that a user is using an ad blocker, they  can then decide how to deal with it.

662,324,7 Tactics Publishers Can Use to Deal With Ad Blockers  The tactics provided by the IAB cover a range of possible implementations and can be used separately or in  conjunction with others. All of the seven recommendations listed by the IAB come with their own risks and benefits. The IAB suggests  publishers weigh up the risks and benefits and consider the type of relationship they have with their audience  before deploying a tactic. Here’s a brief recap of the items mentioned in the Publisher Ad-Blocking Primer and some examples of what  they look like in action. 1.,571,102,142.75
663,324,"Notice  This tactic involves publishers detecting an ad blocker and then taking one or more of the following actions:  Educating and informing the user about the negative implications of ad blockers and the value of advertising  (e.g. free content in exchange for viewing an ad). Requesting the user disable the ad-blocking software in order to continue. Asking the user to donate money to avoid seeing ads. Telling the user that if they want to use an ad blocker, their experience will be limited. The aim of the Notice tactic isn’t necessarily to force the user to disable their ad blocker, but to start a  conversation regarding their ad-blocking choices and encourage them to take a certain action.",702,121,175.5
664,325,"2. Access Denial  Access denial goes one step further by restricting access to the site (or parts of the site) until the user has  completed an action proposed by the publisher — e.g. switching the ad blocker off, subscribing, registering, or  making a donation. An example of the Access Denial tactic can be found on Forbes:  3. Tiered Experience  Unlike the above tactic that denies the user access to content, the tiered experience method works by  delivering a limited or modified experience to a user who has an ad blocker installed while delivering the full  experience to a user who doesn’t. For example, a publisher may only allow users with an enabled ad blocker to read five articles per month, but  let users without ad blockers read a higher or unlimited number of articles.",786,142,196.5
665,325,This tactic is similar to paywalls publishers use to encourage visitors to take out a paid subscription:  Source: The New York Times  332,137,25,34.25
666,326,"Source: The Economist  4. Payment From Visitors  The payment from visitors tactic can relate to both monetary and non-monetary payments. For example, a publisher may ask the visitor to pay a small fee to access the content or provide their email  address. Examples include:  Subscription: A visitor pays or provides some information (e.g. a name and email address) for continued  access to the content, just like in the example below from bild.de. Punch-Card: A visitor pays for a set number of accesses (e.g. $10 for 10 articles).",531,92,132.75
667,326,"Timed Pass: A visitor pays for access for a limited period of time (e.g. $10 for one month). Members-Only Section: A visitor pays for access to content or features only available to paying members. 5. Ad Reinsertion  Publishers can also resort to ad reinsertion, which is arguably the least ethical and user-friendly way to fight ad  blockers. The term describes the practice of finding ways to serve ads to users that have an ad blocker installed.",448,78,112.0
668,326,"Ad  reinsertion may be done with or without the permission of the adblock software provider. While this technique may actually stop ads from being blocked (at least for some time), actual short-term and  long-term implications of ad reinsertion are still unknown—in fact it’s advertising to people who explicitly don’t  want to be advertised to. 333",349,58,87.25
669,327,"The method is a constant cat-and-mouse game that may involve a lot of effort on the publisher’s side, but  ultimately bring little benefit. Ad reinsertion is comprised of three main methods:  Obfuscation: This method attempts to avoid ad-blocking software by changing the names of the ads and their  location on the page. In browser: Similar to above, this method aims to avoid being picked up by ad blockers by using software in  the browser to change the requests sent to the ad resources. On server: Using a process known as server-side ad stitching (a.k.a.ad insertion or dynamic ad insertion), this  method delivers the ad from the same server as the content or service, which avoids detection from ad  blockers.",717,125,179.25
670,327,"6. Payment to Ad Blocker Companies  All of the aforementioned tactics relate to technology solutions, whereas this is more of a business solution to  the ad-blocker problem. Payment to ad blocker companies involves buying your way onto ad-blocker whitelists  so your ads are not blocked by the software. Adblock Plus (ABP), one of the most popular ad blockers, has created a program called Acceptable Ads  Program, in which companies can apply to its whitelist so their ads can still run even if the ABP software is  active. Here’s a snapshot of ABP’s whitelist:  In the image above, you can see that Amazon ads are on the whitelist, which means they should still appear  even if the ABP software is active.",707,127,176.75
671,328,"7. Payment to Visitors  Similar to the previous strategy, this one involves paying or rewarding visitors for their time spent with  advertising. Examples of this include sharing a portion of ad revenue with users and giving them extra playing  time if they view ads on a mobile game. 8. Native Ads  Another effective way to circumvent ad-blocking software is to display native ads.",381,67,95.25
672,328,"Native ads are inherently more difficult to detect, as the ad content is implemented in such a way to largely  resemble the original content on the website. Native in-feed ads match the original editorial content in form and function, making them difficult to detect. This is a very effective way to monetize content, and is used by some of the biggest players in the industry,  including Facebook , LinkedIn , Tumblr , Twitter , and Instagram . Major news media—including Time , Forbes , The  Wall Street Journal , and The New York Times , quickly sensed potential and jumped on the native bandwagon. However, because most native ads are served via third-party AdTech platforms and contain similar elements to  banner ads (e.g. class=”native-ad”), there’s still a chance that they’ll be detected and blocked.",809,138,202.25
673,328,"Opting Out Of Online Behavioral Advertising  Online behavioral advertising (OBA) simply means targeting online consumers with ads that align with their  online behavior — typically, what types of websites they visit. So for example, if you regularly visit websites about cooking, you will more than likely see ads about cooking,  such as kitchen products and cookbooks. Behavioral targeting helps advertisers display ads that are relevant to your needs and interests. However,  some consumers wish not to receive these types of ads as they don’t like the fact that companies collect  information about them. How can Internet users opt-out of behavioral or targeted online advertising?",684,109,171.0
674,329,"Solution # 1: Unchecking the opt-in option found on a web page. Some websites include an option for you to opt-out of marketing for that site. It’s important to note that by doing  so, you are only opting out of this particular site and it won’t opt you out of other sites. When a user opts out or a particular site, a cookie is set in the first-party cookie of the publisher. This cookie is  then checked, typically by a tag manager, before any tags get served.",462,89,115.5
675,329,"If the opt-out cookie is detected, the tags  aren't fired. Solution #2: Turning off the personalization feature on popular search engines (i.e. Google, Bing,  Yahoo!)and other sites (e.g. Amazon and Facebook). 336",213,34,53.25
676,330,"You can not only opt out of behavioral targeting but can also change the settings in your web browser so that  you are displayed ads that are more relevant and of interest to you. If you turn this option off, then you will still see ads, but they will be general and location-based ones, rather  than ones that match your interests. When a user opts out from search engines and accounts, the opt-out request is set at the account level, rather  than saved as a first-party cookie. So when you're logged in to the site, the website (e.g. Facebook, Google,  Amazon, etc.)knows that you have opted out and therefore doesn't personalize the ads or pass additional  information about you to the ad platforms.",703,128,175.75
677,330,"However, this method of opting out does not prevent these companies from collecting data about your  behavior; it just means they won’t use data collected about you for ad personalization. 337",192,32,48.0
678,331,"Solution #3: Requesting AdTech vendors and their clients to not track you across their products. The example above is from LiveRamp, which is a company that provides data to advertisers and AdTech  companies. This is a similar process to the first point, however, opting out of the Ad Tech & MarTech products will apply to  all websites that use that particular software or platform. This method works in a similar way to the first solution, except instead of creating a first-party opt-out cookie on  the publisher’s side, a third-party opt-out cookie is created on the AdTech vendor’s side. Organizations like the  NAI (mentioned below) allow users to opt out of behavioral targeting from all the members (i.e. vendors) in  their organization.",745,126,186.25
679,331,"The third-party cookie's value is then sent with every request to the participating vendors advising them that  the user has opted out and therefore shouldn't apply behavioral targeting in ads or collect behavioural data. While this method allows users to opt out from multiple companies at once, it’s up to vendors as to whether  they respect the user’s decision to opt out or not, but since it's their opt-out cookie, they generally should  uphold the user’s decision. Solution #4: Opt out of behavioral advertising via Advertising Organizations  There are a couple organizations that exist to help online users control how their data is collected and used for  activities such as behavioral targeting. The two main organizations are the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising  Alliance (DAA). 338",825,135,206.25
680,332,The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is the leading self-regulatory association consisting of third-party  digital advertising companies. The NAI is a non-profit organization and aims to promote the health of the online ecosystem by maintaining  and enforcing high standards for data collection and use for advertising online and in mobile. The NAI provides a tool that allows online users to opt out of behavioral advertising. The NAI opt-out tool:  ●  Only affects behavioral advertising. ●  Opts users out of behavioral targeting from NAI members only.,559,89,139.75
681,332,●  Doesn’t delete cookies nor remove online ads completely. ●  Allows users to choose which companies to opt-out of. ●  Sets an opt-out cookie in the user’s browser for each of the companies the user selects. Source: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/  The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) is an independent non-profit organization led by leading advertising and  marketing trade associations. The purpose of the DAA is to establish and enforce responsible privacy practices across the digital advertising  industry to provide consumers with enhanced transparency and control.,581,88,145.25
682,332,"The DAA is the organization behind the YourAdChoices initiative, which is represented by the icon (in the  DAA logo above) on some display ads. 339",147,26,36.75
683,333,"Through its YourAdChoices initiative, the DAA offers a browser tool, known as WebChoices Tool, that allows  online users to opt out of behavioral targeting from DAA’s participating companies. Just like with the NAI opt-out solution, if a user deletes their cookies, then they will have to go through the  opt-out process again. Solution #5: Disabling third-party cookies from being saved in your web browser and activating the  Do-Not-Track feature. 340",453,73,113.25
684,334,"You can disable third-party cookie tracking and enable the Do Not Track option in your web browser by  adjusting the privacy preferences in the web browser’s settings. The Do Not Track (DNT) option requests that a web application disable either its tracking or cross-site user  tracking of an individual user. The DNT header is automatically attached with every HTTP request that the user’s browser makes, but it's up  to the vendor receiving the request (e.g. ad server, SSP etc.)to honour it or not. Apple’s Safari no longer supports DNT as it provides little protection over a user’s online privacy.",602,102,150.5
685,335,"The Implications Of Opt-Out Solutions  There are a 2 main implications opt-out solutions have on the online advertising industry:  1. Lower ROI for advertisers. The implications of opt-out solutions affects both the advertiser and publisher because if more and more users  decide to opt out of behavioral advertising, then this will devalue the publisher’s audiences & traffic and will  cause their inventory to be less valuable. For advertisers, their ROI will be impacted as their ads won’t be shown to engaged or interested users. 2.",536,89,134.0
686,335,"Lower revenue for publishers and less opportunities to monetize the Internet. Currently, publishers and app developers display ads as a way to monetize their content and apps, most of  which are provided for free. The increase in opt outs will result in publishers and app developers charging for  their content and apps. There are quite a few publishers, mainly large news sites, that already charge for their content, but this type of  monetization model could increase. Similarly, app developers could start charging for their apps, which could  lead to a decrease in free apps available to users.",600,101,150.0
687,335,"Differing Views on Data Collection  There are many different views and opinions on the way users’ data is collected, shared, and sold online. Some believe that if the tracking is only for advertising purposes, it poses no great risk to their privacy, while  others believe that it is a clear violation of their privacy and will go out of their way to prevent companies from  tracking their online movements. Online privacy is a hot topic, especially since the NSA scandal broke in 2013 , and with more and more users  going online, the opportunities for companies to target them with their ads is only going to increase. But regardless of your own view on data collection, it is an area of online display advertising that has many  challenges to overcome, both from the business side and from the user side. Online Ads And Their Common Pitfalls Of The User Experience  Apart from the privacy concerns users have about online ads, many also feel the user experience is disrupted  by ads.",986,177,246.5
688,336,"Source: The state of the blocked web, 2017 Global Adblock Report, PageFair, 2017 . Below is a detailed explanation of some of the common pitfalls of online ads. Too Many or Annoying Ads  One of the main reasons why users install ad blockers is because they are shown too many ads, which often  has a negative impact on the user experience. 343",343,64,85.75
689,337,"This webpage has 3 ads above the fold (the top visible area of the page). In additional to traditional banner ads, many websites also have pop-up ups, which are considered the most  annoying type of ad as they tend to take up the whole page, stop the user from doing what they were doing  (e.g. reading an article), and often require the user to click a small cross to close the ad. Adware  Adware is a form of software that downloads or displays unwanted ads when a user is online, collects  marketing data and other information without the user's knowledge or redirects search requests to certain  advertising websites. Adware that does not notify the user and attains his or her consent is regarded as malicious. Adware is the name given to programs that are designed to display advertisements on your computer, redirect  your search requests to advertising websites, and collect marketing-type data about you – for example, the  types of websites that you visit – so that customized adverts can be displayed.",1012,179,253.0

Sometimes there will be no signs of the program in your computer’s system and no indication in your program  menu that files have been installed on your machine. There are two main ways in which Adware can get onto your computer:  Via freeware or shareware : Adware can be included within some freeware or shareware programs as a  legitimate way of generating advertising revenues that help to fund the development and distribution of the  freeware or shareware program. Infected websites : A visit to an infected website can result in unauthorized installation of adware on your  344",692,116,173.0

Creepy Ads  Many consumers feel uncomfortable being shown ads that include personalized elements, such as their name  (like in the Coca Cola ad on Twitter which includes the person’s name - Christopher). Also, many don’t like being shown retargeted ads that display a product or service they looked at previously as  they feel like they are being followed around the Internet and that ad companies know too much information  about them.",619,103,154.75
692,338,"The Future of User Privacy in Digital Advertising  With all the advancements in user privacy over the past few years, AdTech companies should be planning for  the future by making changes to their tech to make it privacy friendly and compliant with privacy laws, and  staying up to date with new announcements around the privacy settings in web browsers (e.g. ITP and Privacy  Sandbox).

AdTech From The Vendors’ And Agencies’  Perspective  So far in this book we’ve mainly been focusing on technical topics and the relationship between advertisers  and publishers, but in this chapter, we’ll briefly cover the business side of AdTech and what that looks like for  technology vendors (e.g. DSPs and SSPs) and advertising agencies. 346",350,59,87.5
694,340,"AdTech from the Vendor’s Perspective  To summarize AdTech from the vendor’s perspective, we’ll look at two main areas: AdTech business models  and the main technical challenges with running an AdTech company. AdTech Business Models  The two most common business models employed by AdTech companies are fixed CPM and a percentage of  the media cost, but many AdTech companies are switching to, or at least incorporating, the traditional usage  model found at other software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Here’s an overview of the main pricing models used by AdTech vendors today:  Business model  Description  Fixed CPM  Clients pay a fixed cost per mille for every  impression served. Percentage of media spend  Clients pay a percentage of the media cost. So if an  advertiser buys inventory at $1.50 CPM, the DSP it  uses to buy the inventory could charge 10%,  meaning the total cost of the ad for the advertiser  would be $1.65.",932,164,233.0
695,340,"SaaS  Clients pay a set price per month based on the  number of users (aka seats). There are many variations of the SaaS pricing model  and many vendors can incorporate elements of it and  combine it with the fixed CPM and percentage of  media spend models. To read more about the above models, we recommend this article by Beewax’s co-founder and CEO, Ari  Paparo: The Entrepreneur’s Guide To Ad Tech Business Models  The Main Technical Challenges of Running an AdTech Company  Although the technical challenges AdTech companies face vary from company to company, there are a few  that all AdTech vendors would experience:  Performance and scalability: Due to the real-time and fast nature of programmatic media buying, AdTech  vendors need to ensure their platforms can handle large volumes of bid requests per second and produce  reports within a short period of time, e.g. showing analytics data within 15 minutes of the impression being  displayed. This is critically important for platforms like DSPs and SSPs that have only 100ms to conduct an  RTB auction. Keeping infrastructure and cloud computing costs down: Because many AdTech platforms handle large  volumes of traffic (e.g. ad requests and responses), it’s important for them to keep infrastructure and cloud  347",1278,220,319.5
696,341,"computing costs down. One way to achieve this is to optimize their cloud computing architecture and select  better performing systems (e.g. databases). Finding developers with skills and experience in building AdTech platforms: Designing and building  AdTech platforms is much different than building other types of software and there’s a long and steep learning  curve attached to it. Building AdTech platforms requires understanding of how the different players and  platforms in the digital advertising ecosystem work and connect together. Finding developers or development  companies with knowledge, experience, and skills in building AdTech platforms is a huge challenge for many  companies.",696,105,174.0
697,341,"AdTech from the Advertising Agencies’s Perspective  As we mentioned earlier in Chapter 04. The Main Technology Platforms and Intermediaries in the Digital  Advertising Ecosystem , many brands have traditionally partnered with advertising agencies to help them with  pretty much every aspect of their advertising campaigns, from creating the ads to running the campaigns  across multiple publishers. But thanks to advertising technology, some brands are taking some of the digital media-buying activities  in-house. In-House Programmatic Vs In-House AdTech  You’ll often hear folks in digital advertising talk about in-house AdTech and in-house programmatic.

Below we’ll look at the three main variations of the in-house model for brands and ad agencies. 1. The Traditional Way of Buying Digital Media  In this first example, a brand uses an advertising agency for their advertising campaigns. The advertising  agency’s AdOps team would then use external AdTech platforms to execute and manage the campaigns.",495,81,123.75
699,342,"The main advantage of this arrangement is that the brand can outsource all of its advertising activities to the ad  agency.

An Ad Agency Takes Programmatic Buying and AdTech In-House  In this third example, an agency has its own in-house AdOps team and its own in-house AdTech platforms. The biggest advantage of taking all aspects of programmatic buying and AdTech in-house is control and  ownership of the technology and data, which will provide the agency with transparent insights into the true cost  of its media spend and audiences.",788,131,197.0

Building AdTech platforms requires a big financial  investment in the beginning and then an ongoing investment to maintain the AdTech platforms.

701,343,"3. A Brand Takes Programmatic Buying In-House  In this example, a brand bypasses the ad agency and uses an in-house AdOps team and external AdTech  platforms. For brands, there are a number of advantages of taking programmatic media buying in-house. The main ones  being cost savings as the brand doesn’t have to pay an ad agency, and more control over their data, ad  placements, and audience relationships. However, bypassing an ad agency means that brands miss out on some of the most critical parts of any  successful ad campaign like brand development, advanced marketing tactics and methods, and large amounts  of creativity, which are all provided by ad agencies.",670,115,167.5
702,343,"4. A Brand Takes Programmatic Buying and AdTech In-House  In this situation, a brand takes both programmatic media buying and AdTech in-house. Just like in the example above, one major drawback is the absence of creativity and experience that’s provided  by ad agencies. The main advantages of in-house programmatic and AdTech for brands are control, transparency, and cost  savings. By using their own AdOps team and AdTech platforms, brands will have much more control over their data and  relationships with their supply-side partners and publishers, and have greater transparency into the  350",597,97,149.25

In this chapter, we’ll list the main challenges and opportunities in the web, in-app mobile, CTV and OTT, and  DOOH industries. The Main Challenges and Opportunities in Web Advertising  Identity and Privacy  In programmatic advertising, identity refers to the process of identifying individual users across different  websites, mobile apps, or other devices. 352",537,84,134.25
709,346,"Identity powers many key AdTech processes, including:  ● Behavioral targeting  ● Retargeting  ● Frequency capping  ● Measurement  ● Attribution  ● Ad fraud detection  The Challenges  For the past decade, third-party cookies have been the main mechanism for identifying online visitors in web  browsers, but this is changing fast. Over the past few years, there’s been a big movement towards strengthening online user privacy. And in digital advertising, strengthening user privacy typically means making it harder for companies to identify  individuals across different websites, mobile apps, and devices. We’ve seen the introduction of privacy laws like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as well as many other privacy laws in other  countries. We’ve also seen many popular web browsers strengthen privacy for their users by limiting or blocking  identification methods.",948,151,237.0

Chrome then  announced in June 2021 that it won’t be shutting off third-party cookies until 2023. When Google Chrome finally does pull the pin on third-party cookies, it will have a much bigger impact on  programmatic advertising than Safari and Firefox have had so far because of Chrome’s global market share. 353",506,85,126.5
711,347,"The changes made by Safari and Firefox have given the programmatic advertising industry a preview of what a  world without third-party cookies looks like, and it’s not pretty. For the most part, publishers have seen CPMs decrease and advertisers have noticed their addressable  audiences shrink. In 2022, all players in the programmatic advertising industry, from advertisers and agencies to tech vendors  and publishers, will need to evaluate their identity strategies and look for solutions that solve their problems,  which may differ from one company to another. Opportunities  For most companies, the opportunities will come in the form of solutions already available on the market. For  others, there are opportunities to innovate and build new tech to power the future of identity or meet their  business goals.",818,133,204.5
712,348,"Advertisers and agencies  In the past, advertisers and agencies have utilized third-party data to expand the size of their addressable  audiences and reach more of their target audiences. The privacy changes mentioned above have reduced the availability of third-party data, leaving advertisers and  agencies looking for new ways to reach their audiences. Here are just some ways advertisers and agencies can navigate the identity challenges in 2022:  First-party data: Most brands collect a treasure trove of first-party data, whether it’s from their website, mobile  apps, CRM platforms, ecommerce tools, or offline systems. But simply collecting this data isn’t enough. Advertisers and agencies will need to activate it, and one way they  can do this is via an ID resolution service.",786,126,196.5
713,348,"ID resolution services and ID graphs: Although some advertisers are moving away from behavioral targeting  and towards other targeting methods, such as contextual, there are many that still see more value in being  able to identify members of their audience across different websites and devices. But with the availability of third-party cookies declining and mobile IDs facing a similar fate (at least, Apple’s  IDFA for now), advertisers will have to utilize a new set of tools to run identification, targeting, and attribution. And ID resolution services and ID graphs are good options to explore. ID resolution services and ID graphs aim to piece together IDs from online and offline channels to create a  centralized view of consumers that can identify them across different websites, apps, and devices. From there, advertisers can run behavioral targeting, retargeting, frequency capping, measurement, and  attribution.",925,145,231.25
714,348,"Contextual targeting: There’s been a lot of talk in the programmatic industry about the revival of contextual  targeting. Even though some advertisers won’t see the same campaign performance from contextual targeting as they do  from other targeting methods like behavioral or retargeting, others may find that this type of targeting is more  effective. Because of its revived popularity, advertisers can expect to see more tools and options for contextual targeting  in 2022 and beyond. Tech vendors  For tech companies, the challenges around privacy have brought about platform consolidation, thrown up all  kinds of obstacles, and threatened their business models. But despite the challenges, tech companies actually stand to benefit the most from the current situation.",773,121,193.25

The changing  privacy landscape isn’t going to bring an end to digital advertising, it will just change the way it’s done. Also, the solution to many of these challenges is a technological one. Below are just some opportunities that tech vendors can take advantage of:  Build identity resolution services: Although there are already a number of ID resolution services and ID  graphs on the market, there are some AdTech and MarTech vendors that could benefit from building their own  ID tools and solutions and incorporating them into their current product offerings. Build or update existing tech: The changing programmatic industry requires tech companies to change their  tech.",781,127,195.25

Innovation has also been a core component of programmatic advertising. We saw this with things like real-time  bidding (RTB) and we’ll see it again with the challenges around identity and privacy. Publishers  The challenges and opportunities that publishers face regarding identity and privacy are very similar to those  that advertisers face. For publishers, the fact that third-party cookies are no longer available in Safari and Firefox and will soon be  scrapped from Chrome means that they’re not able to identify their audience on the same scale as they used  to, resulting in advertisers paying lower CPMs because they’re not able to identify their target audiences.",943,150,235.75
717,349,"This has caused publishers to look for solutions that will enable them to continue identifying their audiences, or  at least part of their audience, and bolster their monetization strategies. First-party data: Out of all of the players in the programmatic advertising industry, publishers are the only  ones that have direct access to the most prized asset of all; audiences. Sure, some advertisers also function as publishers and have access to audiences, but publishers are the ones  that hold the key to the castle. The ever-growing challenges around privacy and identity have led publishers to focus on creating stronger  relationships with their audiences and unlocking the potential of their first-party data. Luckily for publishers, many AdTech and MarTech companies have also turned their focus to helping  publishers unlock the value of their first-party data.",869,138,217.25
718,349,"Examples include:  ● The Trade Desk’s Unified ID 2.0 . ● Independent identity providers like ID5 . ● ID resolution services and ID graphs like LiveRamp , Tapad , Signal , Zeotap , and InfoSum . 356",197,38,49.25
719,350,"Tech development investments: Traditionally, many publishers haven’t seen the need to invest in tech  development, but the privacy and identity challenges are providing publishers with the opportunity to not only  solve these challenges via tech development, but also give them more control over their audiences and data. In 2021, we saw many large publishers invest in tech development, and in 2022, we’ll likely see an increase in  publishers entering this space. The New York Times, for example, has built its own audience segments that it offers to advertisers. By building  out these audience segments based on its rich first-party data, it has taken ownership of its audience and  provided a solution to a problem that is usually handled by tech companies. While building new tech and tools, or even a small amount of custom tech development, won’t suit every  publisher, there are certainly many publishers that stand to benefit by making technology development a part of  their monetization and growth strategy for 2022.",1028,170,257.0
720,350,"Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  There’s also another solution that publishers, advertisers, ad agencies, and AdTech companies can explore;  Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox. Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox is a series of standards and APIs designed to replace the processes currently  underpinned by third-party cookies. The goal of Privacy Sandbox is to maintain targeted advertising and measurement for both advertisers and  publishers, but do it in a much more privacy-friendly way. Privacy Sandbox is currently being worked on in a W3C business group between Google Chrome, Google’s ad  product teams, and independent AdTech companies, publishers, advertisers, and agencies. Although some of  the standards have been tested, it’s not yet known when Privacy Sandbox will go live.",775,119,193.75
721,350,"The Main Challenges and Opportunities in In-App Mobile Advertising  The mobile advertising industry has been on a constant incline over the past 5-10 years, but in 2022, the  industry will face challenges it hasn’t faced before. Challenges  Apple’s Privacy Changes  Traditionally, Apple’s privacy crusade has been isolated to its Safari web browser, but in June 2020 at the  Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the tech giant announced a series of privacy changes to its  upcoming release of iOS 14 that will have a negative impact on in-app mobile advertising. Here’s an overview of the privacy changes in iOS 14:  Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)  Apple announced that it will be releasing a new feature in its mobile devices known as the  AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) framework. 357",799,133,199.75
722,351,"This feature will require app developers to obtain permission from users before collecting the device’s identifier  for advertisers (IDFA) and passing it to AdTech companies, such as ad networks, supply-side platforms  (SSPs), and mobile measurement platforms (MMPs). Apple’s IDFA is a string of random numbers and letters assigned to Apple devices like iPhones, iPad, and  Apple TVs. Advertisers can use the IDFA to identify iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS users across different apps to deliver  personalized and targeted advertising, run frequency capping, measure campaign performance, and attribute  impressions and clicks to app installs. Here’s an example of what an IDFA could look like:  7D902I08D-7846-4CA4-TE6P-83369125YFDC  A device’s IDFA can be accessed by the app’s developer and then passed on to different AdTech platforms. However, Apple’s changes to its IDFA means that before a device’s IDFA can be accessed by a mobile app  developer, they’ll first need to get consent from the user using the ATT framework.",1018,162,254.5
723,351,"Users will be shown a message similar to the one below and asked to make a choice:  If the user selects the Allow Tracking options, then the IDFA will be passed as usual. If the user doesn’t allow  the app developer to access their IDFA, i.e. selects Ask App Not to Track, then the IDFA will be zeroed out,  making it useless from an identification point of view. 358",367,72,91.75
724,352,"The mobile app developer will only be able to ask the user for access to their IDFA once per install. Nobody knows for sure but most estimates put the opt-in rate between 1% to 20%. Tim Koschella, CEO at Kayzan, posted some figures that show the initial opt-in rates were around 15% to 20%. However, it’s still early days and the opt-in rates will depend on a number of factors, such as the vertical  (gaming vs dating) and whether app developers have displayed their own message to users before showing  them the ATT message. As you can imagine, it’s likely that most users will select the Ask App Not to Track option, meaning the IDFA  won’t be as readily available as it is now.",681,127,170.25
725,352,"This will have a negative impact on the performance of in-app mobile  advertising campaigns as ad targeting and attribution will be less accurate. We’ve already seen companies like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter reportedly post losses totalling $10 billion  USD as a result of Apple’s IDFA changes. Many other companies operating in the in-app advertising industry  would have also seen their revenues fall. We’ll likely see similar stories emerge in 2022. Apple’s SKAdNetwork  Although Apple hasn’t offered up any kind of solution for ad targeting, it has proposed a tool for attributing ad  clicks to add installs.",616,101,154.0
726,352,And it’s called SKAdNetwork. Apple’s SKAdNetwork is designed to provide advertisers with conversion data without revealing any user-level  or device-level data. It’s Apple’s version of a privacy-friendly way to attribute app installs. Here’s how Apple’s SKAdNetwork will work:  359,281,41,70.25
727,353,"A couple of points about the SKAdNetwork:  ● The IDFA won’t be passed to AdTech platforms or MMPs, even if the user has opted in. ● All attribution data will pass through SKAdNetwork and then onto the AdTech platform or MMP. ● SKAdNetwork will only attribute app installs (via the last-click model) and not view-through conversions. ● Campaign IDs are limited to 100 per AdTech platform (e.g. ad network or MMP). Privacy Report and ITP for All Browsers in iOS 14, iPad 14, and Safari 14  In addition to the AppTrackingTransparency framework, Apple also announced a couple other privacy changes  in iOS 14 :  1.",610,109,152.5
728,353,"Privacy Report: Users will now be able to see how many trackers were blocked by Safari on a given  page, as well as other information about trackers. 2. ITP for all web browsers: For iOS 14 users, ITP will be applied to all web browsers, not only Safari. This means that all web browsers, not just Safari, in iOS (v14 and above) will include the Intelligent Tracking  Prevention feature. 360",391,72,97.75
729,354,"WWGD = What Will Google Do? Ever since Apple announced its changes to its IDFA, many people in the industry asked the question, “Will  Google make changes to its mobile ID?” In May 2021, Google announced that it will require app developers to include privacy information in their  Google Play Store listings, similar to the privacy information displayed in Apple’s App Store listings. Then in July 2021, Google announced that it would stop passing on its AAID if the user had opted out of  personalized advertising. These changes went live with the release of Android 12 in the later part of 2021.",597,105,149.25
730,354,"While this is considered a privacy change, it’s not as stringent as the ones released by Apple. Opportunities  Just like with the privacy challenges in web browsers, the main opportunity here for companies is to create  solutions that will allow advertisers to reach their target audience and measure the performance of their ad  campaigns, and help mobile app developers to continue their app monetization strategies via advertising. But this won’t be easy, and in some ways it will be harder to solve the IDFA challenges than it will be to solve  the third-party cookies challenges in web browsers. The Main Challenges and Opportunities in CTV and OTT  The hype around the connected TV (CTV) and over-the-top (OTT) industries is akin to the hype around mobile  in the late 2000s. There’s a lot happening in the CTV and OTT worlds, and just like all new channels, they are experiencing a  few teething problems.",912,159,228.0
731,354,"Challenges  The main challenges in the CTV and OTT advertising industries are:  Fragmentation  Unlike the fragmentation of tech platforms and devices that we’re used to seeing, the fragmentation issue in  CTV and OTT runs much deeper. Firstly, every CTV device has its own hardware and software, meaning they all have their own IDs (some don’t  have any!). This makes it difficult to create any kind of unified identifier across all of the different CTV devices. Also, the fact that a consumer might use multiple devices to watch video content across different OTT services  only exacerbates the problem. What this means for advertisers is that it’s quite hard to reach their target  audience at scale within the CTV and OTT environments.",738,127,184.5
732,355,"Compare this to advertising in web browsers. If an advertiser wanted to reach their target audience, then the  only real challenge would be identifying them across different browsers (ignoring for a moment the various  privacy challenges around identity in web browsers). Even though there are many web browsers available, most people use Google Chrome and don’t tend to  switch between web browsers. In the CTV and OTT environments, there are multiple CTV devices and multiple OTT apps, meaning identifying  audiences across all of those devices and apps is a huge challenge. To help alleviate these identity challenges, the IAB Tech Lab has released a set of guidelines to help  companies operating in the CTV and OTT industry use and pass the correct ID from the various devices to  OTT apps and AdTech platforms.",816,139,204.0
733,355,"Measurement  The key to accurate measurement and attribution in digital advertising is identity. And as you saw above, there  are many challenges around identity. In the short term, this means measuring the performance of CTV and  OTT campaigns and attributing ad views to conversions will be limited at best. When it comes to viewability and measurement, there are a few key challenges that need to be addressed:  ● Identifiers: The lack of a consistent identifier across all the different CTV devices means that  identification is fragmented and limited. ● Access to devices: Most CTV devices are closed off, meaning third-party verification tools have  restricted access.",674,111,168.5
734,355,"● Server-side ad insertion: Server-side ad insertion is a common way to serve ads inside CTV and OTT  environments, but it presents many challenges (listed in the next section). Because of the way SSAI is  set up, it is harder to identify invalid traffic (IVT) and collect measurement data. To help address these key challenges, the IAB has been working on refining some of its existing standards,  specifically, VAST and OM. The video ad serving template (VAST) is an IAB standard that is used in video advertising in both web browser  and in-app mobile environments. Although VAST is responsible for video ad serving, it doesn’t handle the  measurement side of video advertising.",681,117,170.25
735,355,"For that, there’s video Video Player Ad Interface Definition (VPAID) . However, VPAID will soon be depreciated and the measurement function of VPAID will be replaced with the  open measurement (OM) standard. The goal of OM is to not only power measurement for video advertising in web browser and in-app mobile  environments, but also in CTV and OTT environments. The IAB is continually working on both VAST and OM to help standardize the ad serving and measurement  processes within the CTV and OTT environments. 362",517,88,129.25
736,356,"Ad Serving  Server-side ad insertion is becoming the main way to serve ads in CTV and OTT environments. Although SSAI  is an improvement on CSAI, it does have a couple of drawbacks. For starters, it’s vulnerable to ad fraud as it’s not easy to identify if the ad requests are coming from an actual  AdTech platform or whether there’s a fraudster on the other end. Because of this, it is also hard for invalid  traffic detection tools to tell the difference between genuine and fake traffic. Secondly, it’s harder to incorporate IAB standards, such as VPAID and older VAST versions, into SSAI.",592,106,148.0
737,356,"But as mentioned above, the IAB Tech Lab is working on updating the existing video ad-serving standards  VAST and OM to support ad serving and measurement. Ad Fraud  Ad fraud has been a constant challenge in programmatic advertising for the best part of a decade, with  fraudsters following the money; from display to mobile, and now, to CTV and OTT. Just like with other channels, fraudsters have been looking for the vulnerabilities and opacity to carry out and  conceal their fraudulent activities. Some of the main CTV and OTT ad fraud schemes that have been detected so far include ParrotTerra ,  StreamScam , LeoTerra, Colorius, ICEBUCKET , DiCaprio , and Monarch . The fact that the CTV and OTT industry is still fairly new, it’s not really surprising that we’ve seen so many ad  fraud schemes already.",809,143,202.25
738,356,"As the industry matures, we’ll likely see more IAB standards like app-ads.txt be adopted, which will help  address and hopefully eradicate some of the ad fraud schemes listed above. But as we’ve seen in other digital advertising channels, ad fraud is a constant theme that is difficult to eliminate  completely. Opportunities  The main opportunity here is to address and solve these challenges via technical innovation. Out-Of-Home (DOOH)  Challenges  The main challenge facing the out-of-home (DOOH) industry is returning to the pre-pandemic levels of both ad  spend and investment in technology. Prior to the COVID19 outbreak, the OOH industry was one the fastest growing digital advertising industries,  with most of this growth originating from digital out-of-home (DOOH).",776,123,194.0
739,357,"When most cities around the world went into lockdown, the OOH market was one of the hardest hit. According to research from eMarketer conducted before March 2020, ad spend on OOH in the US was set to  grow by 3.3% in 2020, with ad spend totalling US$8.87 billion. Adjusted forecasts in June 2020 put the total ad  spend for 2020 at US$8.25 billion. In the UK, a report by the Advertising Association and Warc showed that ad spend on OOH fell by 70.4% in the  second quarter of 2020 . Apart from the impact of the pandemic, other challenges in the DOOH industry revolve around inventory  availability, audience targeting, and measurement and attribution.",653,117,163.25
740,357,"Opportunities  The opportunities in DOOH lie in solving the many technical challenges the industry faces. The addition of the digital, and programmatic, element of out-of-home means that companies need to invest in  developing the technology that will allow DOOH to mirror the other digital forms of advertising, such as display  and in-app mobile. But this is challenging, mainly because it’s much harder to set up a DOOH ad campaign than it is to set up a  traditional display ad campaign. However, as more investment goes into DOOH, the gap between what’s  possible currently with DOOH and what isn’t will decrease. Another Topic to Keep an Eye on in 2022  The topic below isn’t a challenge, but rather an industry trend that we’ll likely see more of throughout 2022.",770,134,192.5
741,357,"Antitrust investigations and Lawsuits Against GAFA  Over the past year or so, we’ve seen a number of governments around the world take aim at the dominance of  Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple in the form of antitrust investigations. This is an area worth keeping an eye on as it may lead to some of the walled gardens spinning off some of  their products and companies, which may impact independent AdTech companies and the programmatic  advertising industry (likely, in a positive way). Below are the main antitrust investigations that have began so far:  The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority Investigates Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox  On January 8, 2021, the UK’s competition watchdog opened an investigation into Google’s intent to eliminate  third-party cookies and other functions from Chrome browser that would negatively affect the advertising and  marketing industry. 364",892,145,223.0
742,358,"Online Publishers Sue Google in Advertising Antitrust Lawsuit  On Wednesday October 20, 2020, Genius Media Group together with The Nation put forward a lawsuit seeking  justice over Google, claiming that it has hurt their businesses by controlling advertising opponents and  displaying anticompetitive conduct. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) Investigates Google  On Tuesday October 20, 2020, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an investigation into Google’s  dominance of its search and search advertising businesses. A Bipartisan Group of State Attorneys General Sue Google  In December 2020, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general from 38 states sued Google for  anticompetitive conduct relating to its search and search advertising businesses. The lawsuit is very similar to the DOJ’s lawsuit (listed above) but provides more examples of Google’s  anticompetitive behavior to secure the dominance of its services (e.g. search engine and mobile apps). Republican Attorneys from 10 States Sue Google Over Anticompetitive Behavior in the Digital  Advertising Market  On Wednesday December 16, 2020, the Republican attorneys from 10 states sued Google for its dominance  of the digital advertising market.",1222,189,305.5
743,358,"The main allegations are that Google overcharged advertisers, boxed out competitors and squeezed  publishers, adding up a monopoly tax on businesses. The FTC and Attorneys General Sue Facebook Over Illegal Monopolization of the Social Networking  Market  On Wednesday December 9, 2020, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 48 attorneys general sued  Facebook for alleged illegal monopolization of the social networking market. Although both of these lawsuits are separate, they were both announced at the same time and concern the  same topic; Facebook’s violation of antitrust laws. The Australian Government Introduces a New Media Bargaining Code to Make Google and Facebook  Pay for Distributing News  While most governments are opening antitrust investigations into Google and Facebook, the Australian  government has decided to tackle the duolpolgy’s dominance in a different way.

744,358,"Then in July 2019, the ACCC released the final report and executive summary. For the most part, the code  would require Google and Facebook to negotiate deals with media companies whereby the tech giants would  pay them for the content they distribute. 365",256,45,64.0
